Robert Mawhinnie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,Great low light lens. Photo was taken with a Nikon D7100
MicahO,3.0 out of 5 stars,Buy the Sigma USB Dock and Calibrate it First Thing or You'll be Sorry- *Updated*,"This is my new everything lens. I've got a 70D that I've been using on an off for a year. Recently I just lost my job and began picking up freelance work and I needed a much faster lens for the new work I was doing. I bought this baby and I love it. I'm able to get very good indoor low light shots and still keep a substantial amount of bokeh. It's got a great build quality and wonderful feel. I still haven't gotten used to the lens zoom which is opposite of Canon lenses but its a small problem I'm sure I'll soon adjust to.I'm sure you can find a million reviews on this lens out there better and more in-depth then mine but I thought I'd give my two cents. I've never broken away from buying Canon before and and there are many out there like my old self. If you are one of those people you can't ignore this beauty. It's a GREAT lens and you won't regret picking one up.*Update*:So a few weeks after writing this post I shot a friends wedding and I found that when taking pictures at around 20 feet or so away I had very soft focus. I learned that day there were a few sweet spots with this lens but the further I got from my subject the softer the focus got. I initially thought it was my 70D camera was at fault after reeding that they had an inherit flaw when shooting in apertures above 2.8. I learned later that this did turn out to be an issue with my camera (not all 70D's do this by the way but it's worth checking out if you're in the market for a fast lens). I decided to keep my aperture at a minimum of F2.8 but my images were still soft.I thought I'd always have issues and was contemplating selling the lens then I discovered that Canon recently came out with 80D and I wondered if this might fix my issues... it sadly did not (but don't get me wrong, the 80D did fix the inconsistent autofocus at shots greater then F2.8). I dug back into researching and found a docking device that Sigma sells that allows you to update the firmware of the lens from your computer. I dug a little deeper and found it also allows you to make micro adjustments to the auto focus.Now before you go out and pick on of these up ($60 by the way) let me tell you a few things. It takes FOREVER to micro-adjust your lens. There are a few video tutorials that tell you how to do it but let me tell you now, set aside about 4 hours or more and do it right. You'll need to buy a lens calibration alignment ruler (there is a paper one sold on Amazon for $6 that works fine) and get set up on a tripod with a computer near by. There are 16 adjustments that need to be made on this lens and each adjustment takes multiple times of undocking and redocking the lens from the computer. Also for the infinity shots, find something very very far away like mountains or a water tower you can focus on with good contrast. This one will be a bit more trial by error but do your best and you should get it pretty close to sharp.After multiple times of calibrating. taking a day to shoot, and recalibrating this lens now shoots AMAZING!!! It's like I have a new lens and it's finally trustworthy. It is razor sharp especially in the 2-10 foot range and the images that are coming out of this lens are down-right stunning.I moved my rating from a 5 at first (until I really got to know the lens) down to a 3 as a result of the year of uncertainty it put me through and wedding images I found to be sub-par (glad my buddy wasn't paying me and was fine with the quality otherwise I would of been furious). If you buy this lens buy the USB dock and a lens calibration ruler first thing and get it set right and you'll love this thing until the day you die. I'll add a photo of my dog that I just shot yesterday. This is what I'm getting at F1.8 from about 3 feet away."
Maruwaan,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sharp, Fast Aperture, Versatile Focal Length, Heavy!","The Pros:This is an excellent lens with really good picutre and video quality. I took a few pictures and asked a few of my friends to guess the camera setup and nobody imagined it to be a crop sensor. The wide f1.8 aperture is awesome for bokeh and low light performance. Also the focal length basically covers 3 prime lenses! The zoom and focus rings are sleek with an overall build quality of a boss. This is the closest you'll get to full frame on a crop sensor body. It's crazy sharp!Now for the drawbacks.This lens is very heavy considering. I have the Canon 200d and 77d, and the lens almost feels heavier than both the cameras together. Make sure you have the correct tripod or Gorillapod if you plan to mount it. At times I'm even afraid to not hand cradle the lens as it just doesn't feel right with my hands on the camera body alone.Second is the focus motor, it's not the quietest and a tad slower than the canon stm lenses. In fact, its so loud that I can hear it even with my on camera Rode mic in auto focus. Just something to consider if you shooting an interview or a video where you require auto focus. Shoot in manual focus instead.Thirdly, lack of IS. Yep, no IS. Ultimately it's wide-ish focal length makes it acceptable.Lastly, this lens only works on crop sensor cameras. So for the price, many believe it to be a bit limiting. So weigh your options and decide if you willing to stick to crop sensor bodies.Conclusion:If you willing to deal with the drawbacks like I was, then it's an excellent lens. It's fast aperture with a versatile focal length makes it's almost impossible to pass up if you have a crop sensor camera."
Dan M,5.0 out of 5 stars,My second favorite lens for my Canon C100,"I love this lens. Love it, love it, love it.I own a Canon 24-105, 70-200, a Zeiss 50mm Makro, Sigma 30mm, previously owned a Canon 24-70, Tamron 24-70, and Tokina 11-17.This lens is amazing, built rock solid. Sharp as a prime, and wide enough that it doesn't look super distorted like my Tokina did when filming indoors.The zoom and focus ring are buttery smooth, just like my Zeiss prime.It works fantastic on my 550D as well.If you shoot video - this lens is honestly a must have. I do like my Zeiss more, as it is an amazing lens, but I use this one 10x as much due to the focal length.I wish it had IS - but hey, can't have everything."
Gerard,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sigma 70D,"I bought this lens mostly for my landscape photography mounted to my Canon 70D. Very impressed with this lens, heavy and I love it."
W. Dyer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sharp at every focal length.,"A very sharp lens, with a very fast and usable large aperture, f 1.8. It is sharp at f1.8 and just gets sharper until f8 when diffraction begins to set in. It is still very usable at f16 for greater depth of field. It is sharp across the field of view, center to corner. It has the focal length equivalent on a full frame camera of 27mm to 52mm. Not a huge range, but a useful one. It is reported to be sharpest at 18mm but it is sharp at all focal lengths. It is a somewhat heavy lens, but very well built. It does not have vibration reduction. But it is very hand holdable in the 1/25 of a second to 1/100th of a second depending on focal length. Higher shutter speeds are of course better. Highly recommended for Nikon and Canon crop sensor cameras."
Andrew P Sorensen,5.0 out of 5 stars,As good as it gets!,"First off know what you're buying...but if you do, you won't be disappointed. This is by far the sharpest lens I've shot with. I plan on shooting with this far more extensively but wanted to say I'm impressed. This is not a ""macro"" lens but I used it to shoot small objects and got far more detail than I had expected.I'm posting a picture blown up to double so you can see some of the detail rendered. On a moth I could see every crease and wave on its wing.I knew this lens would be good, but I had no idea it would be this good.Beware and this isn't the lenses fault but if you're too close to an object this lens will focus on the closest spot it can. It seemed initially like it was misfocusing but it was human error. Most lenses will continue to hunt.Truly a phenomenal lens!"
Jason Garman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing image quality! Focus issues easily fixed via USB dock.,"This lens is astoundingly sharp! I'm using this with a Canon T6i and the resulting picture quality is nothing short of amazing. That said, you will most likely encounter focusing issues when shooting wide open. Then, why a 5 star review? As other reviewers have mentioned, don't buy this lens unless you also get the corresponding SIGMA USB dock for your camera mount.I have to say, at first, I was unhappy with the prospect of spending another $60 for the dock after dropping $900 for this lens. However, the truth is that any fast lens is going to require some level of microadjustment. And, let's be honest, what does Canon do in this situation? Send your body & lens off for ""repair"" to Canon, waiting weeks for them to return, with a chance of being damaged/lost in transit, and to top it off, no guarantee that the problem will actually be resolved to your satisfaction? I don't know about you but the savings in time and lost opportunity cost more than makes up the cost of the dock, and furthermore, I can ensure that the focus meets MY specifications. In my opinion, EVERY lens manufacturer should provide a way to microadjust their lenses in this way (at least until stupid body manufacturers like Canon don't provide a mechanism to do it in camera, shame on you!)Short answer, if you're looking for a great wide to normal zoom range lens for your crop sensor body, with image quality surpassing even the name brand prime lenses in this zoom range, you have to make the investment. You won't regret it.Swingset photo taken at f/2 @ 18mm, spin-a-letter photo was a focus test I took wide open at f/1.8 @ 28mm."
Evie,5.0 out of 5 stars,couldn't be more pleased!,"I would like to begin with stating that I am not a professional, there is so much that I still have to learn about photography. However, I decided to take a leap and make this purchase. First, I received the item three days sooner than expected and that made me super happy. I was impressed with the quick arrival of the product. Second, upon opening up the package and pulling out the lens I was impressed by the weight of it and the feel of it. Again I'd like to state that I am not a professional, however the item did not feel cheap by any means. It has a very solid feel. I's a complete amateur but I love, love, the effect that this specific lens give. I did only receive the lens and played with it for about an hour but still I am super excited to see what this thing can do, OH! yeah one thing that is noticeable is the AF feature, you can hear the lens trying to focus but the lens is pretty awesome I can live with it. Anyway, I will be updating my post after a couple months of use. Anyway hope that helps from an amateurs perspective."
Engedalians,5.0 out of 5 stars,I hated returning this,"Everything you've read about this lens is true. Most would call the end result ""dreamy"". I would call it sensuous. You can almost feel the captured scene. This lens is truly amazing, even more so that it's reasonably priced.I did find however that there are 3 issues with this lens only if you want to make video.1. It has some heavy breathing when in AF mode. I want to use AF since I'm mainly filming 3 small children running around. There is no way I could keep anything in focus using MF. This issue would not affect photography.2. The AF also makes a pretty disgusting noise that is audible within your video. This issue would not affect photography.3. This isn't the fault of the lens, but you cannot mount this lens on the Weebill Lab gimbal. It's just too dang big. You could use a larger gimbal but I really wanted to build a small kit so that I am not some crazy dad chasing his kids everywhere with some stabilizer contraption like this guy pictured below.I returned this lens and got the 12-35 2.8 II. This lens has native AF, power image stabilization and weather proofing. The image quality is superb. It's not ""delicious"", ""dreamy"" or ""sensuous"" but it's still probably the best lens for my needs.I may very well purchase this lens again later in life, but that would simply be for photography or video where the scenes are completely controlled."
Randy W. Dietmeyer,5.0 out of 5 stars,First lens where I actually noticed a significant difference!,Without a doubt the sharpest lens I now own for my 7D Mark II. Putting this on actually made me feel like I upgraded the camera body itself! I just wish it had a wider zoom range and I am still swapping it for my 24-105 L.UpdateThere was a slight flaw on my copy which appeared like a slightly darker curved band on the left side of the photo. It is only visible in something like a bright sky shot and after adjusting the contrast. But it is in every such photo. Other than that the edge to edge detail was phenomenal. Hopefully my new one will be just as sharp minus the lens flaw. Here is a photo showing the slight dark curved band on the left.UpdateI did end up returning it and got a new copy of the lens in today. After a couple of test shots it is clear (pun intended) that this one does not have the slight dark band aberration that my first lens had.
FastK5,4.0 out of 5 stars,Amazingly sharp but very frustrating!,"The sigma 18-35mm is both sharp and frustrating to use. The autofocus is not reliable. But after making adjustments with the USB dock I could get it working well except when shooting objects at infinity with the focal length set to 35mm. I use the Pentax k3 which has a fine adjustment for autofocus. I have managed to more or less get it working at all focal lengths except 35mm (when the object is very far away).This lens is unbelievably sharp for a zoom lens. I have 35mm 2.4, 40mm 2.8, and 50mm 1.4 prime lenses, and it is as sharp or sharper than all these primes. It is amazing in low light too, and sharp at f-1.8. If only the autofocus was more reliable! Live view is always sharp, and that is why it is so frustrating.l will keep adjusting the autofocus to see if I can get it working at all focal lengths. I will update this review in due time."
Lokiparts,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's a Game Changer,"I love, love, love this lens. I am far from being a professional photographer, or videographer, but I would easily consider myself an advanced amateur. For a long time I have been making due with an old 50mm lens as my only real fast lens along with a hand full of slow entry-level zooms and pancake primes. I had been dying to get a fast wide prime, but I was having a hard time picking the perfect focal length. So when I found this lens and started researching it, it almost sounded too good to be true.Well let me tell you on a crop sensor camera, the hype is real. It is so sharp and just takes absolutely lovely images. I’ll admit it’s not perfect, it is fairly large and heavy, and can be a little slow to focus at times, but these small flaws are easily overlooked when it comes to the eye popping image quality this lens produces. Even wide open the images are super crisp. I also recently had the chance to use it for a video project, and it may just be my new favorite video lens too. Overall I just cannot recommend this lens enough. I am fully team Sigma at this point, and I am already saving up to get the 50-100mm F1.8 next."
BS!,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good Lens But Slow AF,"This is indeed a sharp lens. It is bulky (much larger than one would think). The colors are neutral and the images are hard to fault. Very good for indoor and outdoor shooting. Construction is sturdy even though it has lots of plastic parts. I didn't notice any bothersome distortions. For Sony cameras, it's actually a very good choice because it doesn't have any major color casts and is even on the less saturated side, so it minimizes various color casts inherent in Sony rendering when white balance isn't calibrated to a strict 6500K daylight setting.Its one major flaw is focus speed. For photography, it's pretty slow when shifting larger distances. But, the focus speed works out well for video. It's very quiet and moves smoothly. I think this lens was optimized for video. But then again, such a large lens for APSc sensors might not be good for moving about. It'll work fine on larger setups though."
DJ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great but heavy,"Unheard of 1.8 zoom. Using with Sony a6600 which has IBIS. Would be nice if the lens had IS too. Len's AF not as fast as a6600's AF so it's a compromise in keeping up.I usually stop down to 2.8 anyways to keep faces in focus, so perhaps the extra stops to 1.8 are wasted.Downside is the weight to this lens. It's large for a 1.8 lens and it's dated (I think it was released in 2013). Would be nice if Sigma released an update with IS and Sony e-mount compatibility so we don't have to use the MC-11 adapter."
William Elliott,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The best lens for crop sensor DSLR, period.","I own two of these actually. One Nikon mount (review here) and another Canon mount (bought elsewhere). I attach these to my Lumix GH4 and GH5 cameras using Metabones Speed Boosters for video capture. They are nothing less than spectacular. I shoot in a lot of small doctors offices and cramped areas. I also use these for shooting interviews and find they have little to no distortion. They are a little on the big and heavy side, but the quality that they produce is stunning."
Luis L.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bringing almost full-frame quality to APS-C photography,"One of the greatests lenses you can get, it is heavy to carry around, but the results are outstanding. Remember as with any new lens you get, there's a learning curve, so don't rush it in, this one has so many possibilities, and did I mention that it is fast? Having been handling lenses of all sorts for the past 3+ decades, I can assure that this one brings a lot excitement, and incredible pictures! Highly recommend for APS-C sensor formats."
Michael,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent,"I've been using this lens with my Nikon D7100 for over three years and I use it 95% of the time as I shoot mostly landscapes and it works well for portraits too at 30-35mm. This lens brings my Nikon crop sensor camera pretty close to full-frame quality. The only problem I have with using a non-Nikon lens is there's no in-camera auto correction for lens distortion, so I would have to buy Adobe Lightroom to correct for the distortion. I find Nikon's View NX2 software is excellent at post processing my RAW images so I really don't want to buy Lightroom just to fix the lens distortion. And if I do buy Lightroom I'll have to redo all my old RAW files that I've already processed with View NX2. But if you already have Lightroom then there's no reason not to get this lens as it's as good as it gets at a price that's a relative bargain."
DJ Savage,5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite lens above all,"This lens is amazing and probably the best lens you will ever have, but it is only for cinematography. It is a Super clear lens Great for cinema but this is not a lens made for photography. The only thing I did not like about this lens is that it is a bit heavy but maybe that is the reason it is such a great lens, so I can live with that. You will have to add pull focus/zoom gears to this lens, not a deal breaker. If you’re serious about filming, this is your lens."
Kamelle Jaye,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sharp Fast Heavy,"This is my second favourite lens to use overall and my favourite lens to use for landscapes. I own a Canon 80D and I love how sharp my photos look. I'm not too technical when it comes to lens specs but as a casual photographer I usually have this and my 24-70 in my bag. I tried using it for portraits and I kept it at the 35mm focal length. (For me 18mm is a bit too wide for APS-C. I think its a 28mm Full Frame equivalent).The only downsides to this lens are its weight. It is a brick. There also is no image stabilization. Those 2 things dont affect me that much. I only notice the weight of the lens when I go on long hikes, but maybe I just need to get stronger.I love this lens and you won't be disappointed if you purchase this."
Joshua,5.0 out of 5 stars,El mejor lente que hay,"Desde hace mas de veinte años me dedico a la fotografía. He aprendido que en vez de invertir en cámaras hay que invertir en lentes. Pero los mejores lentes son muy costosos. Decidí vender tres de mis lentes. Nikon 35 mm 1.8 G; Nikon 50 mm 1.8 D y mi sigma 18-50 2.8. Y coloqué la diferencia. No me arrepiento. La calidad de lente es superior(algo pesado), trabaja en cualquier condición de luz y mi Nikon D7500 trabaja superbien. Cuando lo compré temí algún defecto de micro ajuste de enfoque. Pero este lente no tuvo ningún problema. De forma preventiva compré el dock. Repito la calidad de las imágenes es superior y disfruto aun mas haciendo mis trabajos de fotografía."
DDuck4Life,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nothing better on the market for what it does,"Fantastic lens. super sharp and has the potential to be my walk around lens. Great for anyone looking to shoot in low light situations and don't want to worry about have the correct prime lens for the situation. If you can find it in stock.the lens is able to focus very fast and with the HSM you can't hear a thing. while you can still hear the motor if everything is completely silent, if there is any background noise going on you won't hear a thing.Amazing for shooting video. the super quiet focusing motor means you won't hear the lens moving to gain focus while filming. Who wants to hear the focus motor running instead of the people in the shot while filming a scene, no worries with this lens.Fantastic for those low light shots where you still need a fast shutter.keep in mind this is not a small light lens. On the end of your camera this will add some size and weight if you are not used to shooting with lens of this size. It has replaced every prime in my kit between these focal lengths.There is a reason this lens is sold out everywhere. don't hesitate to buy this lens if it becomes available to you or just put your name on the waiting list."
Tony,5.0 out of 5 stars,Must have.,"You won’t regret buying this. Great for on the go. I like the weight of it. Feels like quality in your hand bc it is. Image quality speaks for itself. Being apsc, the long end (35) feels like 50 on FF which is perfect and the short end (18) is great for getting that wider shot of you might need in most situations. Having f1.8 all the way through is fantastic.This was the second copy I ordered, bc the focus ring on the first one was a bit weird. This second one is perfect though. Zoom and focus ring are insanely smooth. Love. This. Lens."
Charles Le Pere,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome companion lens to BMPCC6K,"I bought this primarily for video work with my BMPCC6K. It is a spectacularly sharp lens. The build quality is superb. I also have the Canon 17-55mm F/2.8 EF-S (not full frame lens). I definitely like the wider aperture of the sigma more and the fact that the sigma does not telescope through its zoom range, unlike the canon. But canon’s zoom range is greater and it has optical image stabilization, which I am miss greatly on the sigma. So I end up using the sigma for shoots with people using a tripod or stabilizer and the canon for landscape work typically.Again, I love this lens. I would definitely recommend it for video work! And if you’re deliberating between this or the canon, get this one if your primary subjects are people. Otherwise stick to the canon."
clovisthecat,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best zoom lens for aps-c,"I use this on my a6500 coupled with mc-11. sony when used with its native lenses produces a very digital-looking images. But when I put this sigma on, wow, im very surpised it produces images with full of life - similar on what i see with my 5dm4.Image quality is astonishing. Bokeh is great.Cons of using with mc-11 on sony- it keeps hunting for the right focus point and around 70% accurate at Night. Daytime has much better performance. For video work the lens is very noisy so i have a separate audio recording device.I can only wish that its zoom length is much further, has less weight, has snappier focus and has IS. but for its current price, im happy with it and this definitely a keeper"
Doug Davis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Extremely Sharp even at 1.2! (1.2 with metabones adapter on the GH4),"I recently got my Panasonic GH4 and was told this was the go to lens for most shooters with this camera. I did my research and found out this lens becomes a 1.2 with the metabones adapter.. I had to try it out. I purchased this used right here from amazon for a few hundred dollars cheaper and I couldn't tell that the lens wasn't brand new.. It came with not a single mark on it and worked as If nobody ever used it. I'm assuming someone returned it once they found out it was a cropped sensor and wouldn't work properly on a Full Frame Camera. Luckily for me, the GH4 isn't full framed and it worked and looks amazing.The lens is verrrrry sharp even wide open at 1.2 I was shocked! It doesn't have IS but that doesn't effect me because I use a glidecam or tripod, you'll only see a little shake while your filming hand held. It's also around 2 pounds in weight for those wondering.I purchased this for many reasons after countless hours of doing my research. Besides other people praising it.. This is also why I purchased:- Very sharp lens. I read that it is basically a few primes built into one lens. I'd have to agree as it looks great no matter what.- I could go to 1.2 with an adapter and that could help a ton in low light situations.- It has much more DOF compared to the panasonic 12-35 lens and can go to 1.2 instead of 2.8.- I needed help with the low light issue and the Panasonic 12-35 isn't good for low light while this can help me make up for ISO.- Panasonics 12-35 mark II is apparently coming out with the GH5 so I'll wait to see if it's worth the buy later.- Sigma Art lenses have always been worth the money. I've never met someone who has something bad to say about them.I shot an interview this morning for a local gym and had this on my GH4 the entire time. I'll Post a screenshot of the video (ungraded) for you to see."
doesitmatter,1.0 out of 5 stars,Abe's of Maine aka Abe's Electronic Center not Authorized Dealer.,"Read about Abe's online, bait and switch, underhanded sales techniques, etc. Called Nikon and asked about them, they verified Abe's is not an authorized Nikon dealer because of these tactics. They are also not on Sigma's list of authorized dealers and Sigma states on their website they will not honor the warranty if purchased from non-authorized seller. Sent back immediately without using."
Riducharme12,5.0 out of 5 stars,Should Be Your First Lens,"As someone who is just beginning to really get into film, I heard a lot of talk about this lens. I thought maybe, like most things on the internet including reviews, that it might be overhyped. I splurged though and was not disappointed. This lens is fantastic. It does everything you want and gives your film that medium/close up shot that really pops. No need to worry about if your kit glass (the lenses that most people buy with the camera) have enough depth of field to really convey what the subject is, this lens clearly emphasis it + so much bokeh! A great overall lens for film. Would recommend to anyone who wants to start to make their shots look cinematic and beautiful."
Lee O.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Automatic buy! . . . trust me!,"Before purchasing this lens, I decided to rent it for a couple of days and see how well it performed. I used it to take photos for a local late night talk show and it left me very impressed.As many reviews on the internet and youtube might tell you, this lens is super sharp. I never thought I would want to take photos at the widest aperture of f/1.8 but I was so enthralled at how sharp it was wide open. It was matched up to my Canon 70D and it performed well past my expectations. Previously I was stuck with using my Canon 17-55mm f/2.8, which is still a very good lens, but this Sigma trumps any photo I've taken when it comes to clarity, contrast, and sharpness.The only true gripes I might have about this lens, is the short focal range and the speed of the auto focus. My Canon 70D has an APS-C crop sensor, making the 18-35mm range more in lines with 28-56mm (1.6x crop factor). That's still a good focal range for landscape and portrait photography, but too short to use at something like a concert or for sports. The autofocus is super smooth and very quite, but the focus is a little slow compared to my Canon 17-55mm f/2.8. Not that big of a gripe, but when you're trying to capture a moment, every millisecond counts. Also, it doesn't have image stabilization like my Canon, so videography would be a little bit more difficult unless you had a glide or camera stabilizer of some sort.All in all, I made the purchase and I couldn't be happier. Sigma made a believer out of me and I'll continue to purchase from them as long as the quality and performance is there. If you have a crop sensor camera, don't hesitate. Buy this lens pronto!"
Andrew,5.0 out of 5 stars,Focus is off sometimes,Great lens. Only issue I have is the focus on it. Usually when I'm zoomed alllll the way out it may not focus the best. I took some pictures and couldn't tell on my camera that I was out of focus even though my focus point was where it should've been. This can be a big deal if you're getting paid for your photography or videography.
David F.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best auto-focus lens I've ever had!,"There are a boatload of reviews about this lens on youTube so, if you want something detailed, go there. This lens is AWESOME! It takes zero effort to shoot good photos with this thing, even on a D3200!!!!! I can't wait until the 50mm-100mm is released so I can buy that and complete my lens collection!Update 4/1/2016 - I wanted to update this comment with some actual photos of the lens. I have yet to gain skills to properly review it from a technical point of view but would rather let these quick photos speak for themselves. Just a few I snapped, one of which while driving without even looking at the camera!"
Tommy D,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome,"This lens turned out to be heavier than I thought it would be, but definitely not problematic. I like the solid feel it has on the Nikon D500, and even on an older D7100. One of the reasons I went with all Sigma lenses was because of problems with auto-focus. Sigma gives me the option (with the USB dock) of adjusting any back or front focusing issues. I prefer this over trying to go through the incomplete effort of changing the focus issues in the camera."
Nick S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beauty and the beast! All in one.,"Yes, it's big but if you want it for it can do there's no way around it that I know of.I did not want the f/1.8 just for its light gathering capability (although it doesn't hurt to have it) but more for the narrow depth of field it allows. For ""environmental"" portraits (i.e. not just a head shot but also including a good deal of the background for context) with that ""full frame"" look I don't think that there's a more versatile lens for APS-C cameras. Add in the fact that it's just about as sharp (if not sharper) than similar prime lenses and you've got a winner.Update: I forgot to mention that the build of the lens is great. I have some other EX DG Sigma lenses which were well built but this is a notch above those. The materials look like high quality, both the focus and zoom rings move smoothly and without any wobble."
Ike,2.0 out of 5 stars,Autofocus  nightmare.,This is the sharpest POS I've ever seen would be a great lens has very high ratings I cant figure out why. The lens itself is great glass and great quality the auto focus is so bad ... you have to buy the docking station update if available. Mine is already up to date I have to program and change the auto focus at every focal length. NOT EASY. Lens made me want to pull my kit lens out of the closet.
Benjamin Anderson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Investment Ever,"I never write reviews. Today I am. Received mine today and this is the only lens I will ever need again. I was hoping to get my money's worth and I did. Right out of the box, everything I'm shooting looks amazing. The bouquet is stunning. Focusing issues that I've read about? I bought the dock and haven't fine-tuned anything yet and am not sure if I'll need to - I have no complaints. I bought this lens for video after seeing some excellent cinematic-quality footage and I was able to recreate that look within hours. Unbelievable quality. Save yourself some money - this lens is at least 3 primes in one. Amazing in low light too."
ThatCarGuyEddie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect Glass. Fell in love.,"I purchased this lens used from 6ave for $629 shipped. It was said to be in ""like new"" condition, and it was. I was very pleased with the condition it came in. Now for the photography side of this review. The low light capabilities of this lens is amazing. Additionally this lens is great for almost anything else, unless you need to shoot a far distance shot (which I never do). I'll include some of my most recent shots with this lens. Finally I would definitely recommend this to all my friends."
TRJ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sharp as a tack. These feel heavy and sturdy, but they're not. Read review","The actual barrel that the mount base (stainless steel) mounts to is an engineering plastic. So even though it feels and looks all-metal, it's not. And an important piece is breakable plastic inside. The lens will separate from the mount if any hit is taken by the lens and that in-turn tears the flex cables, making a repair an expensive proposition. All in all though, it goes head to head with L-glass for sharpness, bokeh and light gathering. Wish it were a bit more of a range as 18-35 is pretty damn limiting at times."
A. Tolman,5.0 out of 5 stars,solid lens,"This is a large, serious piece of glass. It takes sharp, colorful pictures and, in all the venues I've used it, focuses briskly and reliably. There are times when I wish for a bit more zoom range, but the speed of the lens and the quality of the pictures means that they're croppable without loss of quality. Works very well on my D7100."
Kara Heinrich,3.0 out of 5 stars,Did not fit e-mount,"I was so excited when I saw they added Sony to the compatibility lineup for this lens. Did 3-4 days of research on this lens before biting the bullet and purchasing it. I did not find a clear answer as to whether or not it was for e-mount or a-mount, but after reading multiple articles and watching reviews on YouTubers being excited for the e-mount launch I decided to purchase. When I received the lens it was heavy and beautiful, I immediately went to try on the lens only to discover that it was too big for for the emount. I called sigma and they let me know that anything that just says Sony is an a-mount lens. I did not want to purchase an a-mount converter on top of the lens, so I ended up returning. Disappointed because I was so excited to try out this lens."
Richard,5.0 out of 5 stars,amazing lens but it’s an APS-C,only reason i give it 4 stars is because my sony a6000 with an adapter over shoots the focus a lot and i have to sit and wait for it to adjust multiple times. other than that. one of the best lenses i’ll own. sigma is one of the best retailers for glass. image quality is sharp and crisp per usual from Sigma’s Art series.only downfall is it’s built for aps-c which means it’ll vignette like crazy on a full frame if and when i upgrade to a full frame.
Nate in Florida,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just about perfect,"love this lens, absolutely love it. I have been wanting to get away from the standard low end kit lenses ever since I started photography about 15 years ago, now all I want to do is throw those old lenses away after getting my hands on this. The focus is lightning fast, the auto focus when shooting video is flawless and nobody is going to say anything bad about the f/1.8 at EVERY focal length. I'm taking pictures now that would have been impossible for me before."
Michelet Díez Posada,5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally bought the best APSC lens for video!,"I mainly bought this lens for video for my 80D, works perfectly, it is HEAVY know that, is not a ""walk around take pictures with"" lens.The sharpness is just another level, the focus speed is just right and gotta say is not as loud as many people has said.This lens DOES NOT have image stabilization, so have that in mind, you need a gimbal or have very steady hands."
Julia,5.0 out of 5 stars,Want to improve your video for YouTube? THIS IS IT!!❤️,"I LOOOVE this lens so much! Been wanting this for so long and finally my hubby gifted it to me for Christmas😀 I have a beauty YouTube channel, and I’ve been wanting to get that blurred background as others YouTube’s have, and I got it! Highly recommend this lens if you want to improve your video quality, trust me, your viewers will appreciate that 🔥🔥 This lens is pretty heavy, like HEAVYY:) Took me sometime to get used to that, as well as I had to use a more sturdy stand holder for my Canon M50, but that’s okay☺️ Thanks Sigma for creating such beauty ❤️❤️"
Working Man,5.0 out of 5 stars,Get this lens!,"Words can not express how happy I am to own this amazing lens! It has a very usable range and it goes to F1.8!The lens if very sharp wide open, very little to almost not noticeable CA and vignette. The build quality is very solid, the lens has some weight to it, not to mention it's solid focus along with comfortably dampened zoom and focus rings.I bought this for my Canon 650D which pushes this camera to it's limits! I look forward to more shots with this amazing lens!"
ColoCultureMedia,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are thinking about it, just buy it.",If you are making Youtube videos or any videos. Buy this. There is tons of evidence that this is a great lens on Youtube. I use this with a 70D to make YT videos and with a Lumix G85. Yea it is heavy but no matter what you are shooting it is going to be crisp. The only other lens I use is a 10-18 when needing a super wide angle. This is a bokeh monster. I've even used it to vlog. Willzworldmedia on youtube for more visuals in 4k.
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Simply Amazing!!,"I film short instagram videos and longer YouTube videos. Before i got this lens i was using a 50mm 1.8 stm gor canon. Which was great but i needed alot of space to film which I don’t have so i have to do the filming in a friends house. This lens got delivered from korea in 2 friggn days!! Super sharp, quick AF, not as heavy as exaggerated on YouTube reviews, everything is perfect ❤️❤️👏🏾👏🏾. Best lens for videographers!!"
Tamora,5.0 out of 5 stars,Highly recommended!,"I rented this first to test it out and was blown away by the photos I was getting on my Canon 70D then purchased it immediately. Forget carry a bunch of lenses around. This is basically a bunch of primes in one. I ended up selling my 2 kit lenses, 40mm STM and 50mm f1.8 as this lens replaced them all. Just add good zoom lens to your arsenal and you have everything you need to take awesome photos!"
D. Liu,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this lens,"I love this lens. I use it for all my vacation travels and don't even use my walk around lens anymore. It's super clear and the contrast is good. It's so fast that it's great for low light.This is basically permanently affixed to my canon 60d when i go anywhere. Indoors low light, it helps capture a small room, outdoor and sunny and it's great for capturing landscapes or buildings.I'm debating on buying a canon 5m mirrorless when it comes out and an adapter, instead of moving to another brand because this lens, I really don't want to give it up."
Edgar Campos,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty Good!,"Not the best for portrait photography, but it's solid for cameras that arent full frame! The autofocus is great! Video wise this is the lens to go. Photos, it could be better."
B. Tran,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great lens for Canon 70d,"I've been wanting this lens for a long time and was not disappointed when received. I can't believe how sharp the pictures are and the nice bokah it provides. Do note that you want to do a focusing test and adjustment because I heard that these lens may need them, so if you get it and it is front/rear focusing do the adjustments or send it in with your camera body to get adjusted. Once it is adjusted for your camera you will be amazed how the pictures look."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,The constant aperture and the lens' clarity are phenomenal. ...,"The constant aperture and the lens' clarity are phenomenal. The only two drawbacks are the focal length and lack of image stabilization, but the lack of these features is well worth the price point — especially if you do a lot of model or concert photography and have steady hands. At f/1.8, image stabilization isn't a problem because it brings in a lot of light; either way, find a way to keep your shutter speed above 1/200 and stability shouldn't be a problem."
wile-e-coyote,5.0 out of 5 stars,2 months in this is my go to lens,"Buying used is a great way to save some money and in this case I didn't sacrifice a shred of quality. This is the lens that is on my camera the most. It's super sharp and I love the fact that I get a very shallow depth of field (f1.8) in a zoom. This is much better than the nifty 50 for apsc cameras. The only downside, if you consider it one is the lens has some heft to it, but it's also a mark of the quality that went into it."
Joelrunner,5.0 out of 5 stars,Prime quality with the flexibility of adjustable lenses!,"I had a 50mm prime f1.4 lens, and a 17-55mm f2.8 lens stolen out of my car. I loved (and needed) them both, and was not looking forward to the cost of replacing them... I was hesitant that this lens would replace them both, but I actually like it BETTER due to the flexibility it has.I don't miss either of my old lenses at all now that I have this."
Lester,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing lens for glidecam/steadycam work.,"Man, I cannot praise this lense enough. It is just such a great zoom range for most things, and especially for video production. This thing is amazing on a steadicam/glidecam. The balance barely gets thrown off when zooming and is easy to correct. The ability to open to 1.8 is such an amazing help. While filming a wedding I was so glad to have this fast of a lens and for such a great price.Pros:Sharp!Internal zoomSolid as a rock!Very fast.Little to no lens flaresCons:Not a big fan of the end cap. Doesn't go on very easily.Some may say the price, but I think the price is justifiedNo Vibration compensation"
ashley rippeon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Heavy.  But manageable,Pretty heavy. Takes great pics. Works best at at a smaller fstop like 2.2 or “higher”. Does a great job at lifestyle photography as well as portrait. I don’t seem to get too much distortion up close. My number one lens at the moment.
N. Zahrani,5.0 out of 5 stars,not professional photographer,I'm not professional photographer so this review is from someone who wants a blurry background in a medium sized room (3.5 mt/ 11.4 ft) for YT videos the easy way with minimal fuss- and this lens does jus that and Im happy with it. It's heavy but my gorillapod works fine with it.
waterdog,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Warm this puppy before entering humid environments... but put this in your bag, it's an Excellent lens.","Great lens, will not repeat everything that's been written about it. Much less focusing issues with this lens with my Cannon 70D than my Cannon lens, especially the 50mm. Really surprising and odd. Did have condensation develop INSIDE lens itself when exposed to humid air from cool building. Condensation is a given in this situation but never had it form inside the lens, after 15-20 minutes was still inside lens. After 1/2 hr indoors it cleared. Concerned that moisture could get trapped inside and need servicing. Will make sure to warm this lens in similar conditions.Still this is a 5 star lens, such a solid build and great images. Knowing what I know now will pre warm humid environments."
M,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My new all purpose lens, but adding a 90D.","Found this lens at the last minute, to shoot a wedding with my old Canon 60D. It’s amazing! Hand held shots during Mass, 800 ISO at f3.2 and sharp as can be. Used the 18-35 for 95% of my event.👍"
Ernesto García,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great lens for wide-angle wide-aperture needs, fully recommended","I'm an amateur photographer, and as such, I appreciate the versatility that this lens gives me. First, the wide aperture at a wide angle, something that is hard to find even on primes, and second, the fact that is not a prime lens and allows you a certain degree on zooming, albeit not much. but who would ask for more of this.Ok, but if you're on this page you already know what's the appeal of this lens, you just want to know if it's worth it. My verdict is: it is worth it. The build quality is great, as is its visual appearance. It's a professional-looking lens. And the feel in your hands is amazing. The zoom and focus rings are smooth to handle, and with a very nice grip thanks to the rubberized surface. The image quality is very nice, comparable to prime lenses they say. I don't have enough experience to say it myself, but I can say the image quality is superb. It's sharp, and the bokeh at f1.8 is really nice. That was one of the reasons I wanted a wide aperture lens, the other being shooting in low light conditions, which I already did and was amazing. A friend saw my pictures and thought I had taken a tripod with me to achieve the level of exposure I got from a night landscape.My only reservation when buying it was the fact that there are some worrying reviews out there of people that has had the bad luck to get a copy of this lens that presents some issues with auto-focus. Fortunately that was not my case, but I certainly wouldn't dismiss those concerns. If you can, buy this at store where you can try the exact lens you'll be taking home. In any case, this issue appears to be uncommon.Finally, only buy this lens (or any lens for that matter) if you know it provides the features you look for the most in your photography endeavors. If you shoot mostly at a wide angle setting, and you're craving for more aperture, this lens is for you. Even more so if you're a crop-sensor person (this lens is crop-sensor specific) and you're not planning to go full-frame anytime soon. Also consider some possible inconveniences of the lens before purchasing it, like the fact that is not small, and is not lightweight."
John Lehmann,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,"I was looking at buying several prime lenses and started reviewing this as an option. I am super happy I did. The lens is super fast, has better color capture and a great improvement over the kit lens. The only thing is that it is heavy. But that being said you can definitely tell it is well made."
Arjun Amisagadda,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have heard that this was a nice lens, but my specific models focus ring was ...","I have heard that this was a nice lens, but my specific models focus ring was malfunctioning. At one time it was smooth with quite a bit of tension, but after using the AF in my camera, if I had switched to manual focus, then the focus ring was not that responsive. I don't think that this is necessarily a bad lens, but I think I got a defective product. (using a Canon​ 80D)"
David Alexander,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best for landscape, not portrait","Excellent lens overall, I used it at the Grand Canyon for stunning photos. Not great in low light situations. Meh for portrait. Good depth of field, nice and wide for landscapes. I used it in 16:9 photos, and the daylight photos turned out really nicely."
David Atherton,5.0 out of 5 stars,Incredible lens!!,"Pros: 1. Constant f/1.8 is so nice to have on a variable zoom lens. 2. The build quality in incredible, especially for this price point. 3. Very little chromatic aberration! (Was very impressed) 4. Relatively fast and accurate autofocus with Videography 5. Smooth and quiet ring operation with an impressively long focus throwCons: 1. For crop sensor cameras. 2. Loud auto focus (with sometimes it missing the focus in photography)Overall an absolute must buy lens! I highly recommend it."
me,4.0 out of 5 stars,... 6 months now and feel I can give a useful review. The first thing is this is a ...,"I have had this lens for 6 months now and feel I can give a useful review. The first thing is this is a large and heavy lens. I carried it on a k3ii at the state fair for a full day and was always aware that it was there. This is not a lens that I can ""forget"" is there. Only my 60-250 f4 is larger and heavier. One thing that helps though is that it does not extend when zoomed. Some have complained that the lens cap is difficult to put on and does not stay on well; I find it takes a little more attention when installing but is not that difficult and stays on as well as any other I have. The lens shade is a nice small diameter, unlike the monster on the 12-24 f4, which makes it nicer when in the backpack and not on the camera. Focus is a real issue with this lens and many have given up on it for that reason, though some seem to get a reasonably good one out of the box. Mine was OK at all focal lengths except 35mm which I fixed with a -5 setting at that length with the dock. Now it focuses as well as any lens I have. Sharpness is very good but at 35mm my FA 35 f2 is just as sharp except wide open. I have used this lens indoors without a flash but you must remember that at large f-stops the depth of field is VERY shallow and focus must be spot on to get sharp results. Focus is fast and quiet and it does not hunt. There is some flair under certain conditions but this must be expected with 17 lens elements and so much glass.The build quality is equal to any Pentax lens I have. With the limited zoom range and size and weight that cannot be ignored I consider this lens somewhat of a niche lens; too limited to be a do all walk around lens but uniquely useful for certain applications and I am very glad to own it."
Jaime E. Ortiz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Versatility,"Initially, I tested this lens with my Canon EOS SL2 and worked great! I still need testing it with other cameras, like the Canon M50 and the Sony A7III with Sigma MC-11 adapter, so I will update, but I love it! Very nice pictures out of it!"
GenVicious,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best prime/zoom lens ever!,"I have used a wide range and variety of lenses. This is by far one of the best and more superior lenses that I have ever used. I used to be a big supporter of 50mm f/1.4 lenses, don't get me wrong I still use my sigma 50mm, but the investment on this lens is worth EVERY penny. I'm big on videography and shoot in a lot of lowlight settings. All I have to say is, if you are big on landscape or even portrait photography, this is the lens to invest on. You won't have to upgrade for a long time. This lens heavily outweighs the use of my 50mm. I've never had a problem with any sigma lenses. I was also thinking of getting the 17-50mm f/2.8, but my room mate has one and this lens I have to say still out shines it's performance. If i could give this lens a 10/5 I would, but 5/5 should do. Hope this review finds yous well."
Claire,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great lens; Ridiculous hours spent to adjust focus issues,"Alright so, I like this lens. I really do. AFTER I got it to focus correctly. That is the main reason for star deductions; the time consumption that was put into get this lens to focus was completely ridiculous. And I know its still not focusing crystal clear like I would like but after several hours of constantly taking pictures and adjusting settings use the sigma dock, I finally stopped when I got to a point where I was content with how the pictures were coming out."
Hemifam,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Money Lens!,"This lens is absolutely amazing and guaranteed to make your photos and videos crispy. It has an extremely fast and quiet auto focus, it also fits perfectly in my camera bag. I highly recommend this lens to anyone that shoots photography or films videos for YouTube. You surely won’t regret purchasing this lens."
spl42,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the best lenses out there,"So far this lens has been everything I've been dreaming about for past two years. Image is Sharp, the build quality is top notch it's really solid I'd say about a pound and half of weight. Just well made, great image. I use this strictly for video. If you're looking to take your filming to next level and maybe like me you can't afford a $2,000-$3,000 camera this lens will help."
Eric,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Available Lens For Night And Indoor,"Using this lens for indoor, street, night portrait and day portrait photography is fantastic. You can get a pretty wide panorama at 28mm equiv. if you need it, and 50mm equiv. with incredible brightness and bokeh for portraits. The AF is lightning fast in all but the darkest scenarios and it's nearly silent. The lens is a bit heavy but clearly well built and easy to use, with the focus rings gliding effortlessly. Have used for personal nighttime shoots and professional nighttime and indoor shoots, and the quality is incredible even paired with a simple Canon T3i."
Erick Bonilla López,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing lens. Best lens for crop frame camera's,I looooooove it. Amazing lens. Best lens for crop frame camera's. I recommend it.
Trinh Dennis,5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST OPEN APERATURE ZOOM LENS.,"Purchased this to fit on my Canon EOS m50 with a Canon EF - EF-M lens adapter. Produces pretty sharp images around f/2, unfortunately the autofocusing on this lens makes a little noise and the in body microphone in the Canon EOS m50 would pick up the sound. But other than that, perfect portrait lens."
BlueBomberTurbo,3.0 out of 5 stars,5 Stars Isn't Enough! (EDIT:  3 Stars Until Replacement; See Review),"************************UPDATES AT END************************Used on a Sony A6000 + LA-EA2 adapter.I always have reservations about buying something that's so highly regarded, since usually the hype never matches the reality, or my expectations. This is one of the rare occasions that it does, and even surpasses it. This is the sharpest normal zoom lens I've ever used. And I've used the Nikon 17-55mm F/2.8, Tamron 17-50mm F/2.8, and Nikon 24-70mm F/2.8. Wide open, it's as sharp as or sharper than some high quality primes! The contrast kicks in around F/2.8, but that's not to say the lens is hazy at wider apertures. It's perfectly usable, and stopping down only makes things even more impressive. I took this lens to the New York International Auto Show two days after I got it, and when you're not in pixel peeping mode, it's hard to tell which images are shot at F/1.8 vs F/5.6, besides the out of focus areas.The fit and finish on this lens is top notch, even though it's only made of plastic. The lens is a bit hefty, but you'll see that in most top tier fast zooms, and nothing is faster than this one. The zoom ring is nicely weighted, and the focus ring doesn't stick or feel loose while manually focusing like some modern lenses can. The AF/MF switch is in just the right place when holding the camera, and has a positive click. The AF is also quick and nearly silent (only the photographer would hear it) for photo use. A bit noisy for video with the camera's built-in mic, so you'll want to use an external mic instead.In the end, if you're thinking about getting this lens, the only question on your mind should be ""is 35mm long enough for me?"" As far as anything else in the equation, Sigma has you covered better than anyone else. If 35mm is long enough, there's no reason to hold off on this lens. If not, go out and get this lens and a 50mm prime! ;)PS: I'd HIGHLY recommend getting the Sigma USB Dock with this lens, at only $60 extra. All zooms are known to be a bit off on focus on one end or the other to varying extents. Initially, mine was mostly off at 18 and 24mm, while 35mm was nearly perfect. After calibration, this lens is spot on, tack sharp, every time. Not only do you get the best normal zoom available, it can also be your most consistently accurate autofocus lens, too!************************UPDATE 5/8/15I've been having some serious AF consistency issues with this lens. With static subjects, is as good as your average lens in locking accurately, but with moving subjects, it's a whole different story. The lens tends to lock in front of or behind the subject at least 1/3 of the time. Of course, you can't expect accurate focusing 100% of the time with phase detection, especially when shooting wide open at F/1.8, but the amount that the focus is off is more than just an inch or two, even when stopped down. On a large percentage of shots, the lens will lock onto the background of the image, whether it be a wall or another person standing behind the subject, even if the focus point isn't even in the neighborhood of the background.I purchased the Sigma USB Dock for Sony A-mount lenses (not available on Amazon at the time) when I initially purchased this lens, and calibrated it so focus was spot on. Took a few hours to complete, due to the multiple focal lengths vs calibrating a prime. But all of that work did nothing to improve the accuracy on moving subjects. I learned that the hard when when I shot an event the weekend after receiving the lens. Whether it was broad daylight or very dim overhead lighting, the inconsistency was consistent. I spent a few weeks after that refining the calibration, but nothing has changed.Temporarily moving the rating down to 3 stars, as the optics are still incredible (the in-focus photos at the above event were outstanding!), but without reliable AF, the lens isn't useful for what it excels at: events, especially in low light. I'm sending the lens back to Amazon for a replacement, which will hopefully have proper AF ability.************************"
Bill,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great lens,Very sharp across the frame even at f1.8. f4 is sharp corner to corner. Only downside is the seller I received this from sent an international version with NO WARRANTY. Be aware If you see them going for around $639 you may receive the same.
Eleftherios Kritikakis,3.0 out of 5 stars,"ONLY for specific uses at f/1.8-2.4 of course, heavy","UPDATE: Though I returned this lens because pics were way too flat even for a zoom (depth rendition), I rented a copy to run more extensive tests. It's a little more flat than other zooms at this range, though it's probably the sharpest one in the center of the image, but so marginally you can't really spot much difference.Zooms are inferior to primes in depth rendition anyway, but some manufacturers are trying to combat this (Nikon), others are indifferent as long as the price is right (Canon), others are trying to do everything at once (Tamron).I'm not sure that one would prefer this over what Tamron and Nikon have to offer at the same focal length, but sharpness, yes, it's excellent in most of the image. Geometry it excellent too. But it's also insanely flat, as if one is taking the pic with a telephoto from far away - strong compression that shouldn't exist in this focal range."
Adrian costa,3.0 out of 5 stars,"great quality, but TOO HEAVY","the lens has very good construction quality, the photos are great, the 1.8 blur is fascinating.The bad thing is the weight and it usually has focus problems in some cameras. In my d5500 it was a headache to get the focus right, not so in the d7500"
KieuLy Nguyen,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing quality for the price. Slow and audible auto-focus, though","I've been using this for 3 months now. The photos are incredibly sharp. I have to say however that this lens doesn't have image stabilization but I knew it when I bought the item. That's easily fixable with a rig. What I do find as a small pet peeve is that the lens is slow to auto-focus and makes sound that is clearly audible when I take videos. It's a small fault in the lens and, for the price, I think this is the greatest aperture and length for those starting out in film making and want an all-rounder."
Raj,1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't Focus - Not compatible with canon 60D,The lens is not compatible with 60D as is mentioned in the description. It does not focus and is not what i was expecting from all the reviews that are here.
tman5890,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best lens I've ever owned,"This is the best built, best performing, and best looking lens I've ever owned. I saved up months to purchase this item and I'm so glad that I did. The pictures are amazing and the aperture is fantastic for bokeh. The only downsides are the zoom, if it had a larger zoom I'd say this would be the only lens I needed. I have tried it in low lighting, but have not tried it out for stargazing shots. I plan on taking more pictures with this lens soon and I will update my review with what I find. So far I would say this lens is a must buy!"
Murdock,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great lens, shipped without a lens cap","The lens is great! Good build quality and really sharp. I’m using it with an adapter on my Sony a6500, so I’m not sure if I’m getting the full potential of the autofocus, but it’s a great lens for an amazing price.Only one issue, I bought it used, and it was in fantastic condition, but it didn’t come with a lens cap. Other than that, it’s a fantastic lens for the price."
Lyndsey K. Hinsley,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Fastest and Sharpest Zoom Lens Ever Made!,"This lens was released in 2013 and it wasn't until 2016 that I finally purchased it. It's 2019 and this lens still holds in own as the fastest and sharpest zoom lens ever made. The focus and zoom rings are smooth as butter with a comforting resistance for video/cinema applications. Wide open, at f/1.8, there is almost no chromatic abberation or vignetting. It's simply my favorite lens of all time."
Kelvin Burnside,3.0 out of 5 stars,Everything is excelent and fits my expectations but... There was no USB Dock on the box,No USB Calibration Dock as described
"Mike Mutzel, MS",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Colors and Depth of Field--Highly Recommended,"This lens is absolutely amazing. I use it primary for family photos, cooking images and video interviews.

Before i began making youtube videos i would always hear nothing but great things about the Sigma 18-35mm F1.8. Well i recently purchased this for myself and all i can say is OMG! This lens is incredible i mean where else can you find a zoom lens that has a 1.8 F-stop. This lens lets an insane amount of light in so i can keep my iso setting pretty low when shooting inside. My video quality has left the back of the line and straight to the front. I'm talking ""Team Crispy"" You see up to this point i had been using my 18-55mm Kit lens. So i was blown away by the quality of this lens and how heavy and well made it is. The zoom ring is amazing, i get nice fluid zoom action with the Lens. I am a very happy customer and you will be too. It comes with it's own hood and a very attractive carrying bag for the lens. If i could give this 10 stars i would. The only negative thing i can say is that sometimes the focusing can be a pain, but i am very satisfied with my purchase. So to those out there who want to take their photography and videography to the next level, then this lens is for you! I hope this review helps you with your purchasing decision."
c3h8,5.0 out of 5 stars,My preferred lense,"Very nice images along the entire range. F/1.8 is very shallow, I typically stop to F/2.8, but no issues anywhere along the spectrum."
Piueti Maka,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing lens!!!!,"It is amazing!!!! I’m no professional and I just use it for personal use, but it works soooo easily! I use both the manual and auto focus and I just love it! Focus is better on manual focus but still, so great!"
Ryan D,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect portrait choice for a crop sensor camera,I don't know that there is a better bang for your buck as far as taking portraits using a crop sensor camera. The sharpness and the photos is unreal and the lens feels well-made. Keep in mind if you put this on a full-frame body you're going to get a black ring around the whole photo it's really only going to work on a crop sensor camera.
Nicolas sellar,5.0 out of 5 stars,A MUST GET LENS!,I bought this lens for my Blackmagic and it's simply a great lens to get. The autofocus is very good and the image stabilization is incredible as well. The quality of the stills I take is amazing so that's why I had to give 5 star for portrait photography. A must buy item for any videographer!
apaige,5.0 out of 5 stars,big but sharp,"this lens is big and heavy, but even on the edges of the frame I can clearly see drops of water from my friends running on the breach. This is by far my favorite lens for my 5600."
Brinkbabe9`,5.0 out of 5 stars,High Quality,"You can just feel the quality of this lens when you hold it. Before I even took any video or pictures with this lens I knew I would really like it. After messing with it some I really enjoy it, and how easy it is to get fun shots I have always wanted to get."
James R Propes,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice,"OMG amazing,Running BMMCC with Nikon Metabones adapter.the images are amazing.Dont hesitate, its amazing,Only caveat, its heavy.... but worth it."
Zachary J. Millimet,5.0 out of 5 stars,Super Versatility with F1.8 Fixed Across a Critical Focal Range - Awesome Lens!,"I did a painstaking amount of research prior to purchasing this lens back in December 2013. IAt the time, I was looking to upgrade from the mediocre kit lens that came with my Canon T3i and I went back and forth between this lens, a litany of Canon L lenses, as well as considering just buying 2 separate prime lenses. At the end of the day, I don't think I could have gone wrong with any of my choices. It's hard to go wrong with high end Primes and Canon's L series lenses at the lower focal lengths are fantastic. So why did I buy the Sigma. Certainly, the reviews from professionals were all stellar. This gave me peace of mind Second, I spent a lot of time considering how I like to shoot. I really dislike using flash, bur rather prefer fast lenses with low F-stops to allow me to shoot indoors and in low light situations without flash, when possible. So the fact that this lens allows F/1.8 was a big selling feature. The fact that it was fixed across all the focal lengths really started to sell me. Lastly, this lens covers a small, but critical zoom range: 18-35mm. Especially because I shoot on a cropped body camera, this is the range I mostly live in all the time when shooting. This lens is perfect - functing like a prime, across a critical focal range. Some people have noted that it can be a bit soft on autofocus or mis-focus when using certain camera bodies. I choice my focal points very specifically, and this has not been an issues for me. The bokeh is very good, some lenses are better, but still this lens produces great bokeh. It is also a very large and heavy lens - there is a lot of glass here. Any prospective buyer should be aware of this. For me, I have come to appreciate this heft of the lens - it is part of what I love about this lens."
Travis McGhee,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfection!,This is probably the best lens in my bag. The Sigma 24/70 art is the second best!
Tori L. Jackson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent results! I highly recommend it of you are ...,This has quickly become my go-to lens for portraits and even landscapes. I used this lens on a Nikon D500 body on Saturday to shoot en entire wedding! Excellent results! I highly recommend it of you are looking for an F1.8 that won't break the bank.
Steve B.,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the best lenses in this price range.,"Using this on a Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4K. Easily my most-used lens. No image stabilization sucks, but to be fair the BMPCC 4K should have that internally. Can't go wrong with this one."
Sam,5.0 out of 5 stars,"YES, this lens is worth every penny","All photos shot with the Sony A350 DSLR. I've had this lens for a week now and I absolutely love it!!!the focus is super sharp is manual mode.the lens feels rock solid little on the heavy side but that's OK with me.the auto focus is quiet and smooth which I'm very impressed with. I, maybe like many other people may have watched multiple videos regarding this lens and was unsure... Trust me,bite the bullet and go for it. These photos were shot without the use of a tripod."
Wayne B.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice lens, though quite heavy","Nice lens, though quite heavy, but that is not surprising for a f1.8 zoom lens. Like some others have noticed it seems to have trouble focusing accurately when not in live view i.e. problems with phase detection auto focus, but works better with contrast detection auto focus. I have been using it with a Pentax K-3ii."
Eduardo P.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great lens for Sony A mount and E mount also.,"Great lens, very sharp, it feels robust and very heavy for a short range zoom. It fits and works excellent with my A58 and it's ok for my A6500."
pafeleri,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not for photograhy,This is and excelente lens for making videos in manual mode. I have a lot of problem with the autofocus in the day for events or portrait
gg,5.0 out of 5 stars,Outstatnding,One of the best lens you can have in your camera bag. The quality of your photos and video are outstanding!!
Dr. DieuDonné ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing! Love it!!!!!!!!,For the price is unreal! That’s all I have to say! Oh! And FRO KNOWS PHOTO was right! Best lens for Vloging!
Mariko K,5.0 out of 5 stars,My travel lens!,Love it more than my other Canon counterpart (f 2.8). This is the only lens I use when I travel. I bring it w my 55mm but I do not even use my nifty-fifty anymore every since I got this!
Thomas S.,2.0 out of 5 stars,HORRIBLE FOCUS CONSISTENCY,"I have wanted this lens since it came out. A lot of negative reviews due to focusing but finally decided to get one for my 7D Mark II and 80D. When it hits..WOW RAZOR SHARP - but only about 1 out of 4. INEXCUSABLE. Called Sigma a few times, told me to send it in for calibration - WTF? I have a dock and am going to attempt it nyself."
Michael Mello,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Heavy, but we'll worth the weight!","Omg best lens i've used to date! Only negative is the weight but the auto-focus is great for video, the low F-stop creates beautiful bocca and has improved my low-light photography tremendously! Another key highlight is the fact that zoom happens within the lens so there's no external size changes when zooming in on a subject.Good job sigma!"
Chris J.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent,Updated the quality considerably for my youtube channel. Highly highly highly recommend.
FindingZen,5.0 out of 5 stars,very happy,"Ive had this lens for about 8 months and have not found any fault in it. It is a superior lens for the cost, compared to L glass, its quality seems to be just a good to me. I feel like I got a few prime lenses all in one with this lens. It seems to stay on my camera more than any other lens I have, and its good for a wide variety of shooting."
nathan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best dang wide angle lens,"This is already my second purchase of this lens my first one fell off the roof of a building while at a photoshoot, this lens for the money feels like a canon L series lens with how sharp it is and that great fixed aperture of f/1.8 really shines at night. Very good lens for video as well"
Ray Davis,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Still Shot Lens but,I used this with Nikon D500. Great for still shots but struggles with auto focus for video
Zack hollander,5.0 out of 5 stars,Get it,Ah freakin mazing as long as you make sure you have a crop sensor. Don't be a fool and buy this for a full frame and complain about the vignetting. Autofocus is just slightly slow but really that's being picky
Vic Olavarri,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE IT!,This has been a very good lens for me! Sometimes the auto focus struggles but other than that I haven't had any complaints! Just check out the results on my IG YouSaltyD0g
RM,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful lens,"Bought used and it looks and feels great. Nothing cheap about it, much better then plastic kit lenses or the base level sony lens."
Bill,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice and sharp lens .......>,A great lens for those low-light condition shots. Takes nice and sharp pictures. It is a heavy lens but I'm hoping that means quality. Great for indoor shots without using a flash.
Mhoulder,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just the Best!,"You don't need to buy primes.This is the best all-round lens you can get for wide and standard shooting.I paired this lens with both my bmpcc4k and Lumix g85, using the Viltrox speed booster. Best EVER!JUST BUY IT"
GN Support,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing in low light,"Amazing in low light. If you undstand how to use ISO, F-Stop, and shutter speed you can get extremely good pictures and video. I use a Canon T3i and auto focus is pretty slow with it but I believe that is just because the camera quality isn't the best."
AG,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing lens! Great quality photos,"I bought this lens a few days ago and I am very impressed! This thing is razor sharp and fast! I do some event photography and I was looking for something bright and wide. The constant 1.8 aperture is great for low light situations like indoor photography. I will also be using this lens as my travel lens since it has a wide view.This lens is solid all the way through, it feels like a great quality lens. Be aware that it is long and heavier than other lenses. So if you have little weak baby arms and weight is an issue for you, this might not be for you.I have this lens on my canon 70D and it will probably stay on there most of the time. The video mode with this lens and camera is a whole different animal!I would definitely recommend this lens to anyone using a crop sensor camera. SIGMA is coming out with great quality lens' and you cannot beat the price!"
Em,5.0 out of 5 stars,Meets expectations,It's everything everyone has already said. I love this lens like I love my Canon lenses.The f1.8 is perfect for astrophotography.
Higbe33,5.0 out of 5 stars,Tac Sharp,I love this lens! Even wide open it is tac sharp. Enter your camera into dxomark and check the recommended lenses. I bet this is one of them.It is a little heavier than a normal 18-35 and is designed for APS-C cameras. It is the sharpest lens I own and I've got some L glass. I use it on a Canon 70D.
Gyle Santillana,5.0 out of 5 stars,2 years of hesitating blown away with 1 day of use,"If you like taking pictures whether it's for professional use or as a hobby buy this lens. Yes it's heavy, yes it's a bit pricey but this is very much worth the money if you want an all in one lens. DO NOT BUY A KIT LENS, BUY THIS LENS"
James,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent,Bought this for my mother who is into photography and she loves it!
Thomas Kovacik,5.0 out of 5 stars,The sharpest lens ive ever used,"I use this lens on my black magic pocket 6k and its INCREDIBLE. This lens is so sharp, even wide open. Best lens for your S35 cam."
Zakalwe,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent choice if you can only afford one lens.,"This Sigma lens is the best lens I have ever used. I bought it based on research I was doing to move up from enthusiastic amateur to semi-professional photographer and I wasn't disappointed.Other buyers have left more extensive reviews so I won't repeat what they've already written. I'll simply say that of all the lenses you have in your bag, this should be at the top!"
S. Minor,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect companion for my GH4!!!,"This lens is a BEAUTY. Its solid, heavy, and very premium feeling. It pairs nicely with my GH4 when using an adapter. Its VERY sharp, might as well be a prime. I essentially use it as my 24-70 on Micro 4/3. I pair it with a Rokinon 12mm so I have my wide angle covered and this baby tackles the rest. Smooth focus and aperture ring. Since I use a dummy adapter on my GH4, I haven't tested the autofocus yet. I'm very happy with the image quality and color from this lens, I haven't noticed any chromatic aberration either. It's plenty sharp for the GH4 filming in 4K. It's also very fast, which helps small sensors in dark settings. It doesn't work miracles but it holds it's own. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great all-around lens on M43."
Long time user,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent lens!,"Tack sharp, fast, and excellent build quality."
Rafick Bottse,4.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT,I did not received my 3 year warranty 😒 as written that will be included but other than that everything is great
Nina shrewsbury,5.0 out of 5 stars,Super sharp!,This lens is incredibly sharp! I’m absolutely in love! I haven’t had a chance to take it out much with being stuck inside but I’m definitely excited to.
A. Virili,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sharp, Versatile & Fast - My Go To Lens","Sharp, versatile, fast (lets in a lot of light at 1.8). I use it mostly for video, but when taking photos, the autofocus is smooth and fast. It's solid (and heavy) and I love that it's a completely sealed zoom (more difficult for dust to get into it) with a constant aperture. I have other lenses, but 95% of the time use this one."
Adam R. Herbstreit,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing clarity!,I love this lens and cant wait to keep using it! I never have to change them out for any reason now that i have a wide and a 35!
Keoni Huihui,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just to Have it!,"This Lenses is Sold out everywhere. If you are still using a APC-Sensor DSLR Camera, This in my opinion is a must have Lens. The Sharpness of the photos i took is amazing and the portraits of my Daughter all come out as if i'm a professional photographer. No more paying for those School Pictures, I got this!!"
WannaBeSwimSuitPhotographer,5.0 out of 5 stars,very sharp all around and the colors are beautiful. I wish the reach was further than 35mm ...,incredible lens. very sharp all around and the colors are beautiful. I wish the reach was further than 35mm but I knew that before I bought it. It has been on my camera ever since I purchased this.
Linda W.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome lens,This lens is everything I hoped it would be. I bought it for making YouTube videos. The lens allows me to be close to the camera and gives me that beautiful blurred background I wanted.
jones adirimo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best all round lens,Super clear lens. Currently my best lens for run and gun video production. Best all round lens for the gh5
7302,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great lens,So far this is a great lens. You'll need sigma usb dock to update the firmware.
John Tran,5.0 out of 5 stars,Like having a wide angle prime lens.,I absolutely love this lens. I experienced no issues with front or rear focusing on my Canon Rebel T5. All pictures that I have taken so far with it came out very sharp.
Josh Sandlin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really great piece of glass!,Superp lens. Really goes well with my Canon M50. Feels great in the hand. Zoom and focus rings feel nice.
Paul C.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful Beast,"Shooting at f1.8 allows for the photographic artist to use amazingly small depth of fields. Beautiful sharp results. Way heavy which speaks to the quality of the tube and amount of glass contained inside. The only thing I don't like is that the focus and zoom rings are in the ""wrong"" place for the lens I'm used to over the years."
LA DIY,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great lens for general use,"I use this on my GH4 and get to F1.2 with the lens booster. So far, it's been a pleasure to use this lens. You get a decent shallow depth-of-field for portrait shots while maintaining a wide field of view for general use."
ldiablo,5.0 out of 5 stars,GAME CHANGER,"Totally in love with this lens, many months later."
McMeekin,2.0 out of 5 stars,Bad copy? Returned and disappointed.,"USED ON A CANON t2i CROP SENSOR CAMERA BODY!Wide open there was more than just vignetting around the edges. The entire shot went very dark. The second problem and even more bothersome was the change in the amount of light let in at different focal lengths. The difference is so so so much that any time I zoom in or out, I have to change exposure compensation. To get the same exposure as Canon 16-35, or Canon 50mm 1.8, or kit lens 18-55, I had to set my exposure compensation to +5. What! +5! Any time I have had to adjust to +3 on any other lens I am almost blowing the entire photo out. I had to set +5 just to get the regular amount of light. So when I changed zoom I would have to adjust the other way... all the way down to -6. Is this real life!?PROS:Sharp sharp sharp!Great build qualityAlmost silent auto focusFast fast focus in my opinionI did not have focus problems just throwing this right on my Canon camera body like some forums say.CONS:At least for my copy, these cons were too big to ignore and I sent mine back.Vignetting so bad that it darkened my entire photo when wide open and had horrible vignetting several stops down.Exposure. I had to set the exposure compensation to +5, which on any other lens would blow the picture completely out! Even more, the exposure would differ taking several of the exact same shots one after the other.When zooming from 18-35 I would have to adjust the exposure compensation from either +5 to -6 to keep the same exposure. Yes zooming changed the exposure that much. Same shot, different exposure. Completely unacceptable in my opinion."
Chris,5.0 out of 5 stars,This lens is absolutely stellar. It's so hard to ...,This lens is absolutely stellar. It's so hard to find a zoom lens with a constant aperture that takes this high quality of photos. This should be your first lens purchase after the kit lens.
Patrick Brown,5.0 out of 5 stars,Flawless n,It’s heavy. But the image quality is unbelievable. I’m by no means professional-just an amateur photographer. But my family pictures etc have just been amazing. Wide field of view.
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic lens,"This is hands down the sharpest and best lens under $1000, it’s better than most primes, both for video and photo.My only issue is focus for video can get very tricky with how fast this lens can get"
Kris Hawkins,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great lens for lowlight!,"Probably one of the best lenses on the market for crop sensor cameras, it's definitely a must own for anyone doing lowlight shoots or for people who shoot indoors a lot. It came a day early and it's works great on my Canon t3i. It's definitely my new go-to lens."
RockLobster,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got as a gift...,He loves it!!
Zach Mayfield,5.0 out of 5 stars,SO SEXAY,Rings wore out over time BUT this is the sexiest lens I've ever owned.
Gary,5.0 out of 5 stars,Grear lens! Love it. Back focus issue?,"I am a little curious if the back focus is supposed to be different than front focus. They’re both sharp, but they’re not the same focus plane. Not sure if that is intentional or if lens needs calibrated."
Fritzroy Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,Much better and clearer than the Panasonic native lense,Sigma has outdone themselves with this lens. Much better and clearer than the Panasonic native lense. Do not hesitate to buy if you are thinking about this lens​
ADV47,4.0 out of 5 stars,Incredibly Good Images,"I really love this lens. It gives super sharp images, and is well built. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it is very very heavy and causes some vignetting on still photos and 1080p video with my GH4 (and metabones speedbooster) at its widest zoom."
Dennis S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome lens,"Every time I put this on my camera I get amazing pictures. Super sharp lens at all focal lengths and apertures. I am very impressed. Superb low light capabilities, an excellent lens for shooting sunrise/sunset/night sky. Sigma has a real winner here."

Avai D'Amico,5.0 out of 5 stars,Razor sharp at every focal length. Solid build quality.,"If you're looking for a very well built lens that's razor sharp at every focal length, this is the lens for you. I even bought it used and it's the best lens I've owned."
Joe W. Jackson,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Disappointed, but optically a great lens..",Mine misses focus consistently on my Canon 70D when using the view finder. I have to use Live View focusing to get accurate and consistent photos.. Sigma needs to update the AF system in these bad.. This is heart breaking..
FeatherFur,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice lens. I've been using it for a while ...,Nice lens. I've been using it for a while and there hasn't been any problem with it. Great for beginner video shooting and beginner~intermediate photo shooting on people.
PJ1982_,5.0 out of 5 stars,But its cause its like have a 3 in 1,Amazingly sharp lens. Its a bit heavy... But its cause its like have a 3 in 1 lens
Tony M,5.0 out of 5 stars,High quality lens. I like it a lot!!,"Very nice lens for the price. The quality of pics is better than I expected for my Canon 70D. This is my main lens compared to what I have now which is a 18-135mm kit lens and a Canon 10-22mm because it just produces nice quality pics. Also the f1.8 gives a nice blurred background throughout its range. The lens is hefty and doesn't feel cheap unlike the kit lens that came with my camera,."
Roy,4.0 out of 5 stars,Four Stars,"Really well build lens, Very flexible for any situations... but it is not sharp as expected"
Louis,4.0 out of 5 stars,I wanted to love this lens,"Very, very heavy. I wanted to love this lens, but I need to travel a lot and its too heavy and big! Its so well made. The number of reviews that found focusing problems with Pentax was also a key concern. Its an amazing lens if weight is not an issue. The focus issues seem to be software related so may be resolved in a future update."
Kiowa EM,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great general purpose low light lens,"This replaced my Canon 35mm f2 IS as my low light, indoor general purpose and kid lens for added versatility. Sharp, fast focus, accurate focus, good color and contrast."

James Ephraim Davis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic Lens.,"This lens is amazing. Extremely sharp, well made, and very smooth! Great for indoor shooting and instances without very good light.

Navid,5.0 out of 5 stars,Probably the best lens you can get for a crop body camera,"Probably the best lens you can get for a crop body camera. Much sharper than any kit lens you can get. Definitely worth the purchase for anyone who is looking to drastically improve their picture quality without having to upgrade to a full frame body. However, only works on a crop body camera."
Robin,1.0 out of 5 stars,Does not work,Do not buy a lens from amazon or this buyer the sigma wide lens does not work it will not focus only focuses when on 35mm.. the lens does not work to its capability. And the seller won’t respond to you.
maroc1,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exactly what i was looking for!! Picture perfect!!,Picture perfect!!
william avelar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Recommend picking up the sigma lens dock to fine tune lens to your specific body.,"Great lens overall. As expected from reading other reviews of this lens, needed some calibration with this lens( front focusing ). Once issue was fixed , lens incredibly sharp! Highly highly recommend."
Andrew,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm happy that I made the decision to go with this ...,I was on the fence about purchasing a Prime or a zoom. I'm happy that I made the decision to go with this lens as it offer sharp images and the ability to zoom. Sigma make one fine product!
Ider Santana,4.0 out of 5 stars,very nice,"nice,very nice pics"
Lucia,4.0 out of 5 stars,Four Stars,If you are filming it makes a clicking sound trying to focus which your mic will pick up.
e39'r,4.0 out of 5 stars,Superior build and image quality but heavy and no IS.,"I bought this lens as the final leg of an awesome trifecta... Panny GH4, Metabones Speed Booster and yep... SIGMA 18-35 F1.8. This is an awesome combination and it's done everything I've asked of it thus far. Just for the heck of it I put the SIGMA on my T3i to see how it compared to my Canon 17-55 2.8 EFS. I didn't do the kind of testing you see some folks do on YouTube, etc. but there seemed to be considerably less chromatic aberration around edges as compared to the Canon. I primarily shoot video and if the SIGMA had OIS I probably would have given it five stars. Be warned, it IS heavy and I do miss the range compared to the Canon but the image quality is superior. Like most photo and video equipment, whether or not this lens is for you depends on how you plan on using it. I see a lot of folks complaining about focus issues but as a videographer I just about never use autofocus and because the GH4 has focus peaking I never have a problem getting the shot."
John Giammarco,5.0 out of 5 stars,great product and service,great product and service
Eagle,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than my eye,"I bought this lens for indoor/night photo complementing my Nikon 18-200mm f3.5 Lens I use for outdoor/day photo.I am very, very satisfied with this lens. The picture actually looks better than what my eyes see at low light.I have a Nikon 50mm f1.8 lens. But I often have to back up all the way to the door in order to frame the target appropriately. This 18-35mm lens removes all limitations.Now with one for day light and another for night light, easily fitting inside a light camera backpack, I can not be happier."
Alex Addonizio,5.0 out of 5 stars,You need F1.8,A fantastic lens for getting that creamy bokeh when shooting at F1.8. This lens will make any crop sensor camera look like a professional camera. Definitely worth the buy.
RECON 3155,5.0 out of 5 stars,A must have...,I love it...
A,1.0 out of 5 stars,Unreliable Focus,"I have had this calibrated and looked at up and down. I have played with every setting possible and the focus is 100% unreliable with my 70d. Auto focus on live view is just fine, but for portrait, family or any other single focus activity, this lens give me more anxiety than anything else. For the price I paid, I would expect it to perform sharply ever time. The more I research it, the more it seems that there was a bad batch and I happened to get a bad one."
Grant,5.0 out of 5 stars,10 out of 10 lens,Bought it for nikon and canon. Would do it again to.
An Honest Reviewer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty darn good... But maybe not for pro use,"Pretty amazing lens. It's fast, so great for indoor photography when little to no lighting equipment is available. However, it's focus is not always accurate. That, coupled with it's lack of image stabilization are huge drawbacks. Nevertheless, it is still the best 'pro' lens available for an Canon APS-C body that I know of.Update:So this lens has been pretty consistent. However, it's focusing issues can really be a pain. Don't get me wrong: When this lens hits focus, it NAILS it... but when it misses... HOLY CR@P! If you are a pro (and are for some reason shooting on an APS-C) and you need a lens that can consistently hit focus, you might want to consider getting multiple prime lenses. With that said, this lens is still fantastic - and for those moments where you're not worried about missing THE shot - it would definitely be my first choice."
Jonathan Tran,5.0 out of 5 stars,Heavy,Best for folks who are just getting into cinematography! A bit on the heavy side but images are absolutely stunning!
SteveAnon,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's a Fantastic Lens,"I purchased this lens for my 70D and they are made for each other. It's not silent but it's more than quiet enough for video. I've had it for almost a week and it's been the only lens on my camera since. I'm extremely happy with it's image quality for stills and video and it is solidly built. I haven't tried every lens out there, but it has to be the best zoom lens for a crop sensor. For $800!!!Thanks to 47th St for getting it to me so quickly."
Jarrod,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great range and super sharp!,I absolutely love this lens! I use it with my Red Scarlet on nearly every shoot! Super sharp and very versatile!
Rodrigo Polo,5.0 out of 5 stars,A perfect lense,"This is by far one of the best lenses I have, incredible build quality and results."
HG,3.0 out of 5 stars,Damaged product,"I loved the lens but my product came damaged, the zoom didn’t fully extend to 35mm and the lens was loose falling out of the base. I’ll try again with a new one."
Dominick,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great lens for my D5600,"This lens is the ultimate for low light shooting and bokeh. I use it with my Nikon D5600 and while it’s a great lens, it does struggle a bit with auto focus."
Hein van der Heijden,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,I am having so much fun with this lens on my Canon 70D. Great value for money! Highly recommended.
Kenneth J Urbanek,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My general use lens at 1.8 through range, how can ya do better?","I do not know the answer to that. This lens was selected for its DXO Mark ratings and specs for the intended application. Again quality is there completely. This is my 2nd lens along with the 50 - 150 f 2.8 to run on the DX7100 so I am spoiled with top choice things at this point. As a nonprofessional I expect to learn and do a lot with this package this summer. I have read the good write ups and great owner comments before selecting and I think those reports are spot on no issues. 5-14-14 after doing Mother's day at Cleveland Botanical Gardens and all the flowers and staging, got great results with the lens. Was quick to focus as I was handheld walk about, many people so it was a quick shoot thing and got the shots."

Chi Do,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good lens to cary around.,I love the lens but wish that I have a little bit more zoom. Pictures came out really sharp. Auto focus is fast with nikon D7200. I tried to record several video at very please with the result. It is a very good lens to cary around even though It is on a heavy side. I could cary it with me during two 4hr hiking trip without any real problem.

Chris Shea,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beefy lens that produces EPIC shots!,I love this lens sooo much. The shots you can produce with it will have your jaw on the floor. It's amazing in low light and has massive depth of feel. The glass is very high quality and really gives you crisp images!
Mr.Four,5.0 out of 5 stars,A collection of prime lenses in one lens,"This lens is incredible. How many good things can I say about it? The close focus (especially zoomed to 35mm), the unique look of 18mm at f/1.8, the wonderfully solid build and well dampened zoom and focus rings, incredible sharpness, beautiful out of focus areas (bokeh)... I can keep going!Rather than looking at this lens as a short-ranged zoom, I consider it an answer to the prime lenses Nikon never provided DX shooters with. My bag has been simplified: this Sigma and a Nikon 85mm f/1.8G are all I need to bring.I also purchased the USB Dock to get the most out of this lens. While the lens worked great out of the box, I now have pin-sharp images at any aperture and any distance and zoom."

Tom  R,5.0 out of 5 stars,fantastic lens,"This lens with my 7100 is amazing. Especially for costing less than a grand. I upgraded from a 5100 and the 18-105 that comes with it, so it isn't a fair comparison, but I am very happy with this Sigma lens."

Mindcontrol,5.0 out of 5 stars,Updated review,"I originally reviewed this lens when it first came out around 5 years ago. It's IQ and quality build is second to none. There is review after review online about how good this lens is. It's interesting that I feel limited on a cropped sensor body when I use a 35mm prime, however, when I have this 18-35 I tend to want more zoom. Canon has the 17-40 f/4 that offers 5mm greater zoom however that lens is no where near as good as this lens. I don't even consider them in the same category. There is one major drawback; not enough to reduce a star, but that is the size and weight of this lens. I took some excellent low light fish photos at the Monterey Bay Aquarium with this lens. I was there for approx 4 hours and it did not weigh too heavy on me. Anything longer than 4 hours might begin to takes it's toll if you are not used to carrying around a heavy lens. Overall I don't think there is another lens like this around. It's in a class of it's own. You can replace a few primes (24 and 35mm) for this lens. I enthusiastically recommend this lens."
Steve B,5.0 out of 5 stars,Every bit as good as everyone is saying. I love it.,"I cannot say enough good about this lens. Check out the glowing online reviews and you'll get an idea of how well Sigma hit the mark with this lens. The focus is fast and accurate. It does not come with vibration reduction but a lens this wide doesn't need it.Simply said, this is a premium, fast lens for an amateur photographer like me and it comes at a great price. You won't find a better lens by Nikon at any price.If you have been relying on a popup flash on your camera, you will need to invest in a better one. This lens puts a significant shadow in my pictures when using the pop-up on my D5300."

Steve,5.0 out of 5 stars,Follow some basic rules and you get fantastic results.,"The reviews are spot on concerning the overallquality of this lens. My first impressions were ""WOW"". I immediately tried to take indoor pictures to test the lens out and at first I was disappointed. I am a beginner photographer and my pics were not coming out clear. I tested the D5500 on a tripod and my pics were tack sharp. Handheld, they were out of focus to me so I was getting a little anxious. Finally, I decided to research youtube and customer comments about insuring good focus. One tip helped me achieve excellent results. Shutter speed had to be greater than focal length. Yes, once I made sure my shutter speed was high enough, my pictures were in focus and sharp even wide open. I will use a tripod when shooting anything requiring longer than 18 hundreths of a second and pay attention to the shutter speed when shooting handheld. Hope this helps someone out there who is just learning to take great shots."

Top Notch Approved Deals,5.0 out of 5 stars,Top Notch lens,"I'm using this lens on a Nikon D5100. At first, I had some focus issues, then I purchase the USB Dock and fine tuned its settings. Its a beautiful experience after. Its sharp or sharper than any prime lens I've ever used, even at 18mm 1.8 & across the entire focal length. The trick is to adjust the settings for your individual camera. For my use, this is now my all round lens."
jjk,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!!,Purchased this for my husband's new Canon camera and he absolutely loves it. It allows him more opportunities to take wonderful pictures and interfaces well with the camera.
PhotoBubba,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful fast zoom,"I love this lens. I purchased it to use on my Sigma SD Quattro H camera, and it has wonderful image quality, which is important since the the SD H had 50 MP effective resolution. It also covers the H sensor without trouble, even though it is DC lens. Have not noticed any vignetting at any aperture. This is a heavy lens, so realize that making a zoom that has a 1.8 constant aperture is no ""small"" feat. I worried about whether it would be worth the cost, but it is worth every penny I paid. Excellent build quality, feel absolutely solid, and operate very smoothly. Yo won't be disappointed."
Blaine Harris,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome! Super sharp,"Awesome! Super sharp. Focus at night, it misses but that kind of expective in low light. Also rather heavy but definetly worth having."
RXP Stage II,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great bokeh on aperture priority,Smoker lens for indoor low light photos. Great bokeh on aperture priority. Zoom is useful for framing. Too bad they don't have 35-150mm or similar in F1.8.

sasha,4.0 out of 5 stars,"in which case it works amazing, but slower","the lens itself is outstanding. however, i give it four stars because it has some focusing issues with the cannon 70D. it took a lot of tweaking and it still doesn't quite get it right unless i'm shooting in live mode, in which case it works amazing, but slower. if you're not trying to shoot in high speed situations it does great. i love the shots i can get in low light but most often shoot in manual focus to make sure i get it right."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sharp,You won't be disappointed
Daniel Joseph Design,2.0 out of 5 stars,Terribly Disappointed....,"Let me preface this review by saying I paired this lens with a brand new Canon 70D. So I know the issues are with the lens and not my camera.I did extensive research on this lens. everyone and I mean EVERYONE on Youtube says it is amazing. I found it lacking.+ Pros: wonderful build and feel. It feels like an $800+ lens. I only wish it preformed like one. When it did work, it took beautiful shots+ Cons: Focus - The HSM motor was so loud using it for video (which was the point of purchase) was useless. - Liveview focusing would take 3-5 seconds of hunting OR it just wouldn't find focus and the screen would be completely blurry - focus through the view finder was better, BUT it did tend to back-focus and hunt. At times it took 1-2 seconds to lock on to a shot. For $800, I expect the lens to preform better than my canon 24mm that only cost me $130......I don't know if I just received a bad copy or what, but I say stick with Canon. I wanted to give Sigma a chance and it was just sad. I was excited when the pack came and as soon as I took the first shot I knew something wasn't right.Good luck to you and I hope you found this review helpful :D"

Y. Lee,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best lens I have ever used for my Sony camera,"The one I own is for Sony A-mount cameras. Early this year, I sold my Sony A57 and got the A5100--a E-mount camera. So I now use this lens with an adapter and need to shoot everything manually but still, it works great. I get great image quality consistently.This is, without a single doubt, the best lens I've ever used. It's a ""zoom"" lens with a ""constant"" F1.8 aperture, so you can expect great low light performance at any focal length from this lens. The only con for me is the lens is really heavy and long for my A5100, but I can still shoot great video without a problem.Here's my video that I shot with the A5100 + Sigma 18-35mm at Knott's Berry Farm:https://youtu.be/khZvBZQNygQ"

khary walker,1.0 out of 5 stars,"UNUSABLE PURCHASE, very bad experience with this seller","I Purchased this lense a while back and was very pleased to see that it had arrive looking pristine,basically new although it was listed as used. after testing it on my canon 70d i noticed right away that it wasn't as sharp as all the reviews touted it to be, maybe a bit above kit lense quality , but im not one to complain or rock the boat so i decided to try and make it work, (ever the optimist) over the months there was noticeable degradation to the picture quality , bearing in mind that i didn't start out at the best quality to begin with, i still didn't complain or even thought about coming on here to right a bad review. but now at present this lense (sigma 18-35mm) has stopped all together. it wont focus not even on Manual focus so im basically holding a paper weight now. Im VERY disappointed right now if i had dropped or bumped this lense in any way i would have just own up and called it a lost but after shelling out $650 on a lense naturally im gonna baby it and that i did and still im left holding the short end of the stick. I honestly do think that this seller got there hands on some sub par, below standard sigma gear and and can afford to offload them on unsuspecting amazon buyers at an attractive price. this is so unfair, what does one in my shoe do in such a situation at this point, i'm not one to complain but felt compelled to warn others as i would want them to do the same for me Be extremely cautious if u decide to shop from this seller."

Love My Uke,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great with Canon T6S,"Couldn't be more pleased. I purchased this lens for my Canon T6S. I was a little concerned about ordering as there have been reports of focusing issues requiring the Sigma USB dock to calibrate. I decided against the dock figuring I could always add that if necessary. Well, happy to report that this lens focuses perfectly right out of the box. Both One Shot and AI Servo, no issues. Can focus within just a few inches at 35 mm (actually about 56 considering crop factor) and at f1.8, background blur is excellent and very uniform.I've only taken a handful of pictures with this lens but so far, I would highly recommend it to anyone considering it. Very high quality construction as well. Feels very solid."

JRESH,5.0 out of 5 stars,Super Sharp / Will Not Disappoint!,"Sharper than any Nikon lens I've used.On a 6000 x 4000 px shot, full crop, the sharpness is amazing. There is some distortion and vignetting, but anyone who would care about such a thing should be shooting in RAW format, and therefore would be able to fix the issue in camera RAW with one click. For those of you who are unaware, this is something that happens with even $3,000 + lenses.I have pre-ordered the Sigma Art Series 50mm lens due to the impact this lens has had on me. With Sigma's art series lenses competing with and beating Zeiss lenses at a fraction of the cost, I see myself only purchasing from them from now on."
Ron P,5.0 out of 5 stars,Buy it. Its perfection,"I never write reviews. However this lens is so good, it wouldn't be fair if i didnt write one. This is the best wide angle zoom lens in the world right now. At $800 its a steal compared to canon or nikon alternatives. Its unbelievably sharp. At f1.8 you already know how much light you getting. This lens been sold out for a year, and at least 2 months average wait for back orders. That shows you how great this lens is. Amen."

Some of the pictures and video I get from this thing are absolutely amazing. The incredibly short depth of field is insane! 18-35mm is perfect for video and good for close-up photos.

AQucsaiJr,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic,Never was a huge fan of off camera brands but the capabilities of the lens are second to none. The price is also spot on.This lens has been an absolutely awesome lens to shoot with. The camera I use is the Canon 60d. This has become my go to lens for shooting indoors and also close up shots of my kids. After using this lens it has defiantly made me a fan of the Sigma art lens line. I am already looking at my next Sigma art lens.

Fellow Traveler,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Fine Lens....as Advertised!,"Congratulations to Sigma for bringing us this new and exciting product and, whats more, at an affordable price!The lens is everything it's advertised to be and I got first-rate images on my first time out in shooting low-light street photography situations on my Canon 60D. Focusing in low light situations did not prove to be any problem which was the only possible criticism I have seen others make. With more use, I expect I will enjoy this lens even more. The only possible downside I have is that the lens is a bit heavy and gets some getting used to. But then, given what it does do, one doesn't expect it to be able to zoom out to 120mm or make the morning coffee or other things as some self-appointed ""expert"" nit-pickers would want it to.At this time, there is no Canon or other lens out there that can match what this lens can do and at such a reasonable price. Thanks, Sigma."
Daniel Acosta,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Product,Choose this for the 18-35mm range.I like the fact that it doesn't extend when you change the focal distance.Have all the benefits of a prime lens and is not plastic
maskirovka,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you shoot low-light events like dance, performance, or sports you DEFINITELY want this lens","This is a review I expect to update as I continue to use my brand new Sigma 18-35mm F1.8 lens. I am not a super-technical pixel-peeper kind of guy but I am a pretty experienced photographer and I'm writing this with a similar audience in mind. I bought this lens because I do a lot of event photography, especially dance (doing volunteer work for a ballet company) and while I've done pretty well with my trusty Canon 24-70mm F2.8 lens, I've felt a bit (sometimes more than a bit) limited when I photograph fast moving dance sequences in the low-light environments stage and dance very often are. That's because the 24-70mm F2.8 simply doesn't do as well on an EOS 7D with its 1.6x (APS-C) crop that it does on a full-frame like my EOS 5D Mark III.That's what's one of the very nice things about this lens. You get the same performance on the crop body with it that you get with the 24-70mm on the full-frame. And that's important because my crop body with its 8 frame per second burst capability is the best camera for catching action (as opposed to the significantly smaller burst capability of the 5D Mark III).07/17/2013:So let's start with the first impressions:1. The price on this lens is great. If it had been Canon or Nikon, I would have expected paying far more than what Sigma is charging for a game-changer lens.2. The build quality is very nice. Holding the lens in my hands, it feels solid and well-constructed.3. Although the lens is not a macro, I was impressed by how close it could focus...I actually was able to get good, sharp images of my parrot's face when I focused in below the ten inches that the specifications say it can do.4. The lens focuses very quickly and the small number of images I've captured with it appear good and sharp. When I open it up, the bokeh appears very nice as well.5. The lens is very quiet...I could hardly hear it while it moved to focus.6. I also think that the lens is fairly low-profile...one wonders if Canon had made it whether they would have made it white which could draw unwelcome attention when doing street photography.As far as negatives go, nothing leaped out at me. Some might not like the fact that you can only stop it down to F16 but who is going to use a lens like this for landscapes?***07/28/2013I'm writing to update this review now that I've been out with my Sigma 18-35mm F1.8 on an EOS 7D body to two events I photographed. My subjects were both the same...the ""Nat Pack"" entertainers that give t-shirts away and dance on the dugout roof during breaks in the game.I can't figure out how to upload photographs to the review site here (I'd welcome any help on that). In the meantime, you can see the photos from one game that I took on my flickr account photostream. Just go to that website and add after the .com suffix ""maskirovka77/sets/72157634795619485/"" to see the shots.Frankly, I'm delighted with the lens. Even shooting with it opened all the way up, it was easy to get nice sharp, vivid pictures of the Nat Pack with good bokeh. The lens focused rapidly and I didn't wind up with very many blurry shots at all.I won't even call this a drawback of the lens, since I'm sure that it's a result of optics and mechanical limitations, but the focal length range of the lens is not as good as the 24-70mm F2.8 lens but that's life.One other thing I've realized is that I can pretty much put my old 50mm F1.4 on the market because the Sigma gives me so much more flexibility with its zoom."
Destre,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quality,I love this lens! One of the Lenses that make taking pictures fun!
Chels K. Von,5.0 out of 5 stars,amazing,love my new lens!!
Ian,5.0 out of 5 stars,so my love for the Sigma lens might be extremely skewed,"I needed to upgrade my wide zoom range as I have a big gap between 16mm and 70mm. I was using an old MF Vivitar 28-50mm as my primary lens in this range, so my love for the Sigma lens might be extremely skewed, but the Art lens is gorgeous. The sharpness throughout the f stops is excellent where it is supposed to be, and very good where other lenses would show their weaknesses. Whenever I scroll through my Lightroom catalog without any picture information turned on, it is immediately apparent which pictures were made with the Sigma.One thing I did have to get used to is manually focusing on this lens. I mainly shoot railroad subjects, so I do not have much need to have a quick auto-focus and I learned on an MF/film camera - I'm just most comfortable setting my focus point manually. In the first couple of outings with the lens I caught myself focusing PAST infinity, and thus resulting in very oddly, and out of focus images. I cannot knock the lens for my own learning curve. Just something to be aware of, and I'm not sure I've heard any other comments related to my early problems.Bravo, Sigma. Looking forward to many other future pieces of glass!"
Dae,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,Looooooove this lens! So crisp and heavy duty!
Gabesbarista,4.0 out of 5 stars,Four Stars,Great lens. a little slow at focusing. using on a Canon 70D
Shawn Strong,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice. It works well with the Metabones adapter,Nice. It works well with the Metabones adapter. I loved the Olympus 14-35mm better but it weighed more and bigger. This lens is nice though. Sharp.
Brian Kelley & Carolyn Taylor,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Lens for the Price - Some AF Issues Wide Open,"For those graduating from a kit lens to something slightly better quality, the Sigma 18-35mm F1.8 for Canon is an excellent option. The AF when stopped down is an annoyance, as other reviewers have mentioned, but I've been able to switch to manual or simply AF a few times as a work around. Almost all photos on my site were shot with this lens and a Canon 7D if you need examples: carolynkelleyphotography.com."
Solomon Roberts,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,The best len
Azavier,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,excellence lens
Meesh,5.0 out of 5 stars,Another great lens from Siggy,"I bought this for my D7100 after reading reviews, and it's a great lens. I used it for an event and the look of the photos easily matched what I would have expected from my D600 in terms of beautiful IQ, and subject isolation. I am very happy with this purchase."
Elemino,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome Lens!,"The YouTube lens, or so it's called. This was exactly the reason I bought it, and it does a great job fulfilling my many needs. For filming and studio work it's an amazing lens. It's also great for photography, but for my needs it's on the heavy side and I always think twice before deciding to tote it somewhere. Still for it's intended purpose, I'd rather have the weight and build quality than the alternative. This is more or less a prime lens with some zoom, and the results are generally amazing."
This guy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"best lens on market in this price range for ""regular"" photos","if you had to get a single lens to do everything, this is it. Attached photo of running faucet in a bathroom. Amazing speed on this lens, even in low light conditions."
Josh S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,Best lense I've had. It drops down to 1.8 constantly which is cool.
Carlos Eduardo Rivera,5.0 out of 5 stars,excellent!!,"(purchased on december 18)......This is a very good lens, excellent build quality, f1.8.. say no more, sharp images..... I cant say everything about this lens because Amazon doesnt allow to write in spanish.. too bad Amazon,....... very good job Sigma"
DroneDJ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Consistent and accurate focus problem solved????,"Yesterday:Hi there, I recently bought the 70D and the Sigma 18-35mm....wanted to love the lens but got very frustrated about its inability to consistently get the focus right...I am still in the process of figuring out how to improve it while shooting wide open and am not done testing. However I think it may be related to a very thin focus pane in combination with the way the 70D focusses...see here for more info. [...] I am hesitant to buy the USB hardware for the sigma lens. Also I have already micro-adjusted the lens +20 on both near and far....I hope, I can figure out a way to solve this quickly otherwise I may end up returning the lens....it is just too frustrating to miss focus in so many shots, especially indoors....BTW - I wonder why Sigma has responded to this issue yet....Today:Ok - I think I may have found the solution... for shooting wide open with this lens in combination with the 70D....1) set micro adjustment to +20 far and near2) set camera M, P or C3) shoot in live view mode4) press AF button on top, select Flexizone single5) press magnifier 3x to zoom in 10x (2x = 5x zoom)6) half press shutter to focus7) take photo in focusI ave tried this at 1.8, ISO 200 in dim lit room and got sharp focus in every shot...Works for me. Curious to hear about your experience.Thanks."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Killer lens in ever way. I have absolutely zero ...,"Killer lens in ever way. I have absolutely zero complaints.I know 3rd party lenses often take heat for being cheaply made but this is truly a solid product. I knocked my tripod extended to 6 feet off the top of my SUV while shooting a few months ago and my camera and this lens took a tumble with it. After the fall from about 14 feet up onto solid pavement my camera's sensor cracked but this lens only suffered gashes on the front lip. I can no longer put filters on it but considering that fall I would absolutely say this product is well made. Oh, and did I mention that sharpness?"
bb58,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this lens,"Pros: Excellent bokeh, very fast auto focus though I use the manual focus most of the time. f/1.8 picks up great light at night and is very crisp when stepped down to 2.8 and on. Metal body makes it very solid construction.Cons: It makes the camera a little front heavy. The difference is definitely noticeable when compared to the 18-55 f/3.5 lens kit I got with my T3i, but with a nice neck strap or tripod it's hardly a problem.Definitely would recommend for someone who is looking for a great wide aperture lens"
"DIX PIX photo, video, and pro audio",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sharpness of the image using an a6300 in 4K 30fps with metabones speed booster can't be beat for a wide ZOOM lens!!!  STUNNING!!,"There's NO WAY there's a better video lens for the a6300 (if it is appropriate to use, meaning for being close up, or for wanting to be wide).WELL-- first let me state 2 things, first off, I am using the metabones speed booster adapter for Sony A mount to Sony E mount, and THIS set up sets this lens on FIRE, turning an F1.8 into an F1.3, which is the KING set up PERIOD. There's nothing like it, AND it's affordable.This lens is for APSC sensors, or APSC mode, not for full frame 35mm sensors.ALSO: Use of the metabones focal reducer (speed booster) is best suited for the cropped sensor version you get on the a6300 shooting in 4K at 30fps. When you try to use other modes, even 24fps 4K will cause vignetting on the lower range of focus, and some 18mm to 22mm will have vignetting.NEVERTHELESS--- go ahead and use it in 4K at 30fps, and THIS is just incredible what you get!! less than 2 meters from a subject, you can capture the entire room, and still zoom all the way in, and make your subject larger than life!!I just shot 2 days in the studio in North Carolina, and then an event the following day, all 3 days using this combo, (Sigma 18 35 with metabones speedbooster on a6300).I am certain auto focus is NOT something you would want to mess with, as trying to take stills using auto focus does NOT work, and that is an issue that makes me wish I had purchased the version of this Sigma 18 35 for CANON, and then the more expensive metabones adapter, but THEN be able to use the Sigma MC-11 adapter that is claiming native auto focus! (anyone tried that with VIDEO??)Me and my Dad can't believe what we just saw, even on our old 1080, 63 inch plasma TV, that was the most amazing footage of ANYTHING we have ever seen!! SO sharp, it's like looking through a WINDOW!The mics on the a6300 are WAY better than the a6000 now, and VERY decent, although of course not PRO audio grade.Don't EVEN question it if you are intending to shoot 4K with either the a6300, or using crop mode for your A7sii, and A7rii. For that matter, who has footage from an FS5 or FS7 using this Sigma lens and metabones speed booster?? THEN you could still keep zooming in!! THAT must be just out of control at F1.3!!ALSO-- this must be a monster low-light combo with the A7sii, which I will shoot next chance I get!!GOD!! I just wish I could include footage, but that would be a copyright issue to even send a link at this point, but YEAH, this is PRO grade stuff BY FAR in a VERY in-expensive package for some $2250, a6300/metabones speed-booster/Sigma 18mm to 35mm Art (and a tripod, this lens is not stabilized, and neither is the camera, BUT tripod duty does GREAT, and this has to be the most portable PRO 4K set up you could possibly get, for an amateur level price, for sure!!If you then get a Shogun or similar 4K recorder and monitor, YES, this is in FACT professional grade, although my Atomos Shogun Flame did not arrive in time for my event, forcing me to record internally, which I did with no overheating, and I managed just fine to NAIL focus. My eyes are perfect, but I did use the EVF, not the 3 inch LCD, which is borderline worthless, especially when using a wide lens.SO-- I will be keeping this a6300 in my bag with an A7sii, and A7rii, and of course, this lens is going to be used whenever possible just to get that shockingly SHARP image!!BAD ASS LENS!! Does very well shooting stills too, although using an laea3 could definitely be better auto focus, and using the laea4 would cost you the light you just added with the speed booster adapter.I was happiest using manual focus, and when zooming, it stayed ""sharp as a tack"", although it is softer on the edges than it is in the center, but it actually is an ""ARTSY"" effect that looks VERY nice, and puts extra emphasis on the subject in the center, so GREAT for shooting MUSIC events both in a studio environment, and concerts where you are either close, or want to get EVERYTHING in view, (or BOTH-- and then if you stick that on an FS5, you could keep zooming in from there!!) I'll be getting into an FS5 as well, especially now that I have several amazing E mount lenses and adapters."
JeremysSpoken,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome Lens.,This is by far my favorite DX lens. I would like more just like it in different focal lengths.
yelena gorbacheva,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,very satisfied
Fareed Rajack,5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST LENS I have ever used,"BEST LENS I have ever used ! I own a Canon T5i and a 70D . This lens is super fast and sharp . I am amazed at how it performs in low light. I own the 18-135 mm , the 40mm pancake, the 55-250 stm and the Tamron 150-600, and this Sigma is now the Icing on the Cake !"
Neal H,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Panther in the Jungle Night,"I own a 70D and purchased this to essentially replace the 18-35mm IS II. Sigma's lens of course murders the kit lens. It does indeed feel like a handful of wide primes, in optical quality and over all weight. As others have commented, it's a heavy bastard, a drastic departure from the kit lens. But I have grown accustomed to the heft. Even on hikes and lugging it through the streets I am not beat by it's weight, it's certainly noticeable though.The quality and range of having that 1.8 is worth any issues I have encountered. The detail at f2 and smaller is ridiculous. Partner these facts with it almost queer ability to focus as close as 1/3 of a foot and I want to take this baby around the world and marry it."
Doscho,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gorgeous lens,"If you are considering this lens, stop. Buy it. It is in high demand because it is the best value glass for a crop lens in these focal lengths. I mourn every time I take this lens off to shoot wildlife with my 75-300 f4-5.6.The specs alone are obviously impressive, but the quality of the glass is really exceptional. Wide open it is extremely sharp with very attractive bokeh, and I haven't noticed any chromatic aberration or soft spots at all. There can be a TINY bit of vignetting, but I don't mind it (when I even notice it).Overall I am extremely satisfied!"
V,5.0 out of 5 stars,Must have lens for your dslr!,"I've been using this lens for a while on my Nikon D7200, I waited to do a few jobs well with it then to come and review it! It works! and it works well! beautiful pics, clear and spot on focus accuracy! I use it as my primary lens and it doesn't disappoint under any circumstance! I love the work sigma has done to this lens. It's more affordable to get this than original Nikon and it's the same quality"
Andy McCracken,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,"New favorite lens, has replaced all other lenses I have except for my telephoto"
AK,5.0 out of 5 stars,One great lens,"This is one very well-made lens. A robust build and weight too match. You can feel the quality of this lens when you are using it or just holding it in your hand.A bit on the heavy side, not a problem when you see what a great job the 1.8 does in low light. Just a great lens to have in my camera bag.I really, really, really love this lens. It just shoots so well. Great for getting impromptu shots without having to swap out from wide to 35mm primes.One thing I do not like is the lens cap, replaced. Also to note is that the marking on the lens barrel does not match up with the Canon camera body. The marker points straight up on the lens to mount, stupid call on that one Sigma."
Dan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,Bitchin lens
Beau Kester,5.0 out of 5 stars,BEAUTIFUL lens!,Great lens! I use this for my Canon C100 and C300 for film production. Highly recommend!
Kal,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exactly what I needed,"Amazing lens. Haven't taken it off since I bought it! I do a lot of portrait work, and I find that this lens doesn't have that much distortion compared to the kit lens that came iwth my camera. I bought it so I can photograph events more easily, and the constant 1.8 aperture is perfect for that. (YES! It is a constant aperture. It can shoot at 18 f1.8 and 35 f1.8)It is sharper than my Nikon glass. No regrets. Cheers to you, Sigma!"
Claudio Pereira,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful lens for D7100,"I bought the Nikon mount for my D7100. Very similar to the Sigma 35mm 1.4, but a little bigger. Wonderful IQ, sharpness, bokeh at all zoom range. I took tons of pictures. Very precise and quick AF. Didn't need to fine tune. I really recommend it! Congratulations to Sigma. Now I have four of their lenses."
Jose Perez,5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite lens!!,Best and favorite lens I've ever used! Highly recommend this! Worth every penny!
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,Excellent lens!
GMAN,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Glass,"This is a very nicely built lens.I have avoided Sigma recently due to build quality issues in the past.These new lenses are build of quality.I was saving for the Canon L glass, but with the cost savings, and build quality of the new Sigma Art series lenses.I had to buy it.It is quiet, sharp, fast, and priced right. Usually you can only pick two."
robert peteson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sigma,Awesome lens with super fast silent focusing and crazy goo picture quality! I would totally recommend adding this lens to your collection.
cherie22984,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great lens for the price,"Its sharp, fast, and silent. Yeah, its heavier than your average lens but that is not a real issue for me. Looks and feels high quality!I haven't noticed any auto focus problems like some reviews say, been using on D7100 with no issues at all."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,I love the lens .
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Lens, Wish it Had Image Stabilization","This was one of the first lenses I purchased and it has served me very well. It is extremely well built and has a very solid feel. It is a tad heavy but that is a sacrifice I'm willing to make for build quality. One thing I've found I really miss from this lens is image stabilization. The auto focus is also rather poor for video, though I mostly use manual for video anyways. You can hear the clicking in your recording and it spends much time searching. Image stabilization and video auto focus aside though, excellent lens."
I buy a lot,5.0 out of 5 stars,The bokah achieved is awesome! No problems built strong and performs like the ...,OMG!!! This is an incredible lens! The bokah achieved is awesome! No problems built strong and performs like the pro lens it is!
SCMowns,5.0 out of 5 stars,2 Years later and still amazing,"This was my fourth lens that I had purchased for my Cannon EOS 60D and I was looking for a lens that would look sharp, professional and would take amazing portrait photos. I was not disappointing as it picks up a lot of light with F1:1.8 and auto-focuses very quickly without noises. It's built with very strong material and you can feel the quality from this lens."
Daniel Antonio Morales Letelier,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,"It's simply amazing. My D7000 has a before and after with it. Strong, smooth and fast."
Jays,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bang For The Buck!!!,Superbly magnificent lens!
Doug English,5.0 out of 5 stars,It also takes a good quality shot,"Despite its size, Sigmas' 18-35mm lens feels well balanced on the camera. It also takes a good quality shot. The lens is somewhat pricey, but the build quality and the sharp images it produces, more than compensates for its cost. A good lens for serious picture takers."
Dean Can,5.0 out of 5 stars,"OMG, sharp WIDE OPEN.","OMG, so sharp, I absolutely love the colors and resolution of this lens. It's APSC only (unless you're out at 35mm) regardless, if there is one lens for everyday shooting on any APSC camera this fits the bill. One thing though, this puppy is heavy!"
Carlton,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,Great Lens. Sharp Images and amazing build quality

Voltron,5.0 out of 5 stars,Maybe my favorite lens I have for the GH4 or the a7rii,"Maybe my favorite lens I have for the GH4 or the a7rii. So versatile, and throw on a speed booster to get an even sharper, faster lens. It is really amazing that sigma made a 1.8 all the way through zoom. This is made for a crop sensor, don't get this for your full frame or you will be bummed."
Jepoy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!,Thank you for a very nice product!
Jonathan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,Great service and great product. Thanks guys!
The honorable,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing lens. Top image quality,"Amazing lens. Top image quality, versatile wide aperture, and robust construction. A bit heavy and bulky, but not a big deal considering the results. Much cheaper than any red stripe Canon lens, and probably even better quality."
Myron,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fact and sharp,"This is the fastest zoom you can get on a crop sensor. It's sharp, focuses quickly and well, nice range for portraits, groups and walk arounds / street photography. My favorite lens for 90% of my shots... Highly recommended!"

I was worried about AF issues after reading other posts on here but I did not find any AF Issues while using my Nikon D5500 . Great auto focus, great sharpness. This lens is a MUST for any DX camera. If you are considering to upgrade to an FX camera, you should try this lens and keep your DX camera instead. The low light capability and noise reduction and color dynamic is great"
AϾ,5.0 out of 5 stars,A nice alternative to canon,Very professional lens for the price. A nice alternative to canon lenses
Nick lenn,5.0 out of 5 stars,Paired with the MC-11 adapter on my A6300 it is AMAZING!!,"One of, if not THE, sharpest crop lenses made. Paired with the MC-11 adapter on my A6300 it is AMAZING!!!!"
Ebrahem,4.0 out of 5 stars,I love this lens it's sharp,"Pros: I love this lens it's sharp. Versatile and I have it all the time on my camera, I take a lot of street photography and travel photography. It feels solid in your hand.Cons: it Catch dust and becomes dirty very easily. It miss focus but I used to it as I zoom in and check my focus."
Joseph T.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great lens that surpassed my expectations,"Very smooth auto focus, sharp wide open, and got me to believe in Sigma.After hearing great things about this lens, I made the leap and purchased it. I couldn't be happier, and now a believer in sigma. Now I eagerly anticipate their next ART lens - the 50 1.4. I have strictly used canon L glass in the past, but see the commitment to quality and results."
amazon customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Focus Lottery,"I read a lot of glowing review of this lens, including on the (Amazon affiliate) dpreview.com and DXOmark.Everybody praised the fantastic performance ... 3 fast primes in one package.Well, this has been my dream since I take photos ... to have truly stunning image quality over a reasonable zoom range so no lens change is needed.So LBA kicked in, and I got this lens.At first, I couldn't believe how soft it is at f1.8. Didn't seem to match the razor sharpness everyone was talking about?!Until ... well ... until I realized that practically no image was in focus!Since my Pentax K3 has a very useful focus fine adjustment, I thought ""no problem, lets fix it"".A few hours later I gave up:This lens mis-focuses in a way I have never ever experienced before, not even with the most crappy third party lens from 20 years ago!The only way to describe it is ""Focus Lottery""!No reproducable front or back focus ... the focus point is all over the place. Essentially random.Is this maybe Sigma's idea of an ""art lens""? :)Since all my other lenses focus better than ever on my new K3, I can positively say its not the camera.After some more reading on the web, I realized I am not alone. There seems to be a number of other users with similar problems, since the lens was launched well over a year ago (I bought it in May 2015).Shame on Sigma that this is still not fixed!Thanks to Amazon for a hazzle free return policy!PS:yes, I also read (and can confirm) that it focuses well with life view.Well, this is not an option for me, as I don't use an SLR to be limited to life view.And yes, IF the lens focuses correctly, it exhibits stunning image quality.Actually better than some of my Pentax limited lenses! Shame I cannot use this and have to return to my old trusty Tammy 17-50 2.8 as a walkabout zoom."
Brandi Engel,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love this lens,"Love this lens! She is my go to and my baby. Creamy bokeh, quite lens too. Only reason for 4 stars is that it is heavy, but that is what you get for great quality glass :)"
dfw1417,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Lens - Worth every Penny! Thanks Sigma!,"This Sigma 18-35mm F1.8 lens is super! I was reluctant to spend this much on a lens. The last zoom lens I purchased was Sigma 28-300mm f3.5-f5.6 for my Canon T2i and it has not been off the camera since I bought it over 3 years ago! Now that I got the Canon T5i I wanted a lens with great low light capability and all of Canon's was over $1000 each!I was impressed from the time I took it out of the box. This feels like a real LENS not a cheap plastic immitation like Canon's kit lens! This is quality from the start! I immediately tested its low light ability shooting in AV priorty mode I chose f1.8 using iso 400 and just a normal 60w room lamp in the bedroom I was able to shoot several shots at about 1/15th sec shutter speed. I tried the low end 1.6 x 18 mm = 28.8 full frame equiv up through 1.6 x 35mm = 56mm full frame equivalent. I was really impressed with the quality and sharpness of the photos from end to end.I am so glad I got this I had it on order for over 30 days with B&H who seemed to take most of the month of September off every time I went to check on my order there was some dumb closing for another Holiday notice, I dont see how they stay in business they are closed more than open!So I cancelled my order and could not find it in stock anywhere! I just happened upon it on Amazon when there was 3 left in stock, with prime shipping trial I got if OVERNIGHT for $4.00 cant beat that!This is the best lens I have owned.Thanks Amazon and Sigma ... your the best!"
John,5.0 out of 5 stars,Buy this lens now,"This lens is incredible. I'm a Sony videographer using a canon mount and I cannot speak highly enough of this lens. Just buy it, seriously, its that good."
Cam Hurd,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the fat aperture.,"Amazing lens. The fat aperture is awesome. It's physically solid, and produces a crystal image."
Raymond Young,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lucky enough to get this while it first came out,"Sigma built this lens like a tank. I was happy how smooth the zoom was. I have other Sigma/Tamron/Tokina lenses where the zoom sounds so mechanical. Every one of course would have wanted this at 18 to 55, but that's what you get for being the first zoom 1.8 out there. The pictures come out brighter in the dark, compared to the actual scene. But I noticed 1/40 1.8 was a minimum shutter speed I needed for my Canon t4i to focus correctly, otherwise at a slower shutter speed it would not focus right in low light at ISO 1600. Shooting at 1/3 stop over, my girlfriend's pictures turned out bright and complementary, smoothing out her complexion."
Hardmf247,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not Sharp,Not real happy with the lens. Was just okay out of the box but not better than my kit lens. Actually my kit lens is sharper. Don't know if the lens is defective or if it needs calibrating. Maybe the the lens would be great if I wanted to spend a half-day calibrating it with the Sigma dock but that's not going to happen. The lens should be dead-nuts accurate/sharp out of the box. I simply don't have the luxury of spending that kind of time calibrating something that should have been done by the manufacturer. Maybe I'll return the lens for another...I'll update my review if I get another.Update: I purchased another lens and it is better out of the box than the first. But it still isn't as good as I expected/hoped. I will eventually take the time to calibrate it with the Sigma USB Dock and I'll update again. I should also say that I have a Canon 70D. For now my rating of three stars will remain.
Pat J. Dooley,5.0 out of 5 stars,People say this is like three primes lenses in one,"People say this is like three primes lenses in one. It is. The f/1.8 is not a gimmick. You can shoot wide open and your images are sharp and free of chromatic distortion. It is a big, heavy lens. But it takes beautiful photographs and lets you blur out backgrounds to perfection. It is also very sharp, much sharper than any kit lens. It has some competition, but it will see a lot of time on my A77ii body."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Super heavy and not convenient to carry around,"I dont understand the hype, maybe it’s because I paired it with the song a6300. Super heavy and not convenient to carry around. Sigma is coming out with e mount versions, maybe I’ll try back then."
AJW.1,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hail Sigma!,"This lens deserves all the accolades and more... not a single complaint out of me... love this piece of glass! I seen complaints about the lack of image stabilization but to that I say use a flash and faster shutter speed, put it on a tripod... you can't compete with these images on a crop sensor body!"
Barbara D.,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this lens!,"Love this lens. Just love it. The extra opening (f 1.8) for low light work are just enough so I can now capture a concert, or people at a dance, without needing a flash or having blur. Clear lens too, and nice bokeh (background blur) when shooting something like a flower. Only drawback is it sometimes takes too long to ""hunt"" on autofocus -- not always -- otherwise, it's wonderful, and it's a gift to have a lens that stops down to 1.8 that's a zoom, even though it only goes to 35mm. With my APS-C crop-factor the 35 is the equivalent of about 52 mm. I'm so pleased."
edgar,2.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT BUT....,Its an AMAZING lens when it works. I have used this lens at a local car show and the results were just really disappointing. I would say 85% of my shots were out of focus and the rest were SPOT on and very very sharp! I read that you need to tweak the lens by connecting it to your computer via usb but why would i purchase a lens that simply doesn't work rite out of the box plus purchase an adapter to connect to my computer? My 50mm 1.4 and 35mm 1.4 shoot flawlessly and i have been looking for something wider below 20mm for my 80D camera. I would love to keep using this lens but that requires purchasing additional equipment and modifying it in a program that i would have no clue how to use.
Hithem Y. Geddeda,5.0 out of 5 stars,perfect lens!,"Bought it for my d7100 and its always on since then, perfect lens !!"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,I absolutely love this lens,"This item was in pristine condition. I absolutely love this lens. After doing tons of research, I knew I wanted to purchase this lens but I was still anxious about the price tag. I am supremely happy with my choice to buy it used like new."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great lens,"My most favorite lens, I do videography and some photography, and by far this is the best lens to get. With such low aperture it is perfect for any dark(er) environments compared to kit lens, but the glass on this is incredible, it gives out amazingly sharp images. Props to Sigma on this one."
hector caroro,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's true but it's not that bad. I'm using a 70D body and most of ...,"Very sharp lens. Other photographers may have issue with the auto focus. It's true! At first it miss 70% of my shot. Please adjust the Lens Micro Adjustment on the body. Be mindful that this lens don't have vibration control so keep the shutter speed @1/200 or above on hand held or as steady as you can. I'm using a 70D body and most of the shot was on point after the lens micro adjustment on the body. I had no auto focus problem after the adjustment. Work like a charm! Yes the lens is very heavy but most lens at this level are. Just like the weight of canon L series. For the quality build and image sharpness, this lens makes up for it. Having 18-35mm wide is very useful. Specially shooting a big group of people."
Vladimir Mischenko,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice!,Very sharp. Auto-focus is correct and fast enough.A little bit heavy. And zoom range isn't enough sometimes. Not good for the case when you need a quick shot.You also need manually set aperture value if you want nice boke on portrait photos.

J.J.R.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Problems With Sony Cameras???,"I'm not sure if I got a bad copy or if I'm just having trouble with my LA-EA4 and LA-EA1 adapters compatibility with this lens.First of all, I don't have the Sigma USB mount to check the lens firmware but when I got the lens, the first thing I did was mount it on the LA-EA1 adapter and mount it to my Sony a5100. I had the camera on Manual mode and I can see right away that the camera wasn't reading the F-Stop...just blinking F/.. but I was able to fire off a few shots but then, my LCD screen went blank. Tried turning the camera on and off but seems like my battery died (it was at 45% when start up), I replaced the battery but seems like the a5100 combo with the LA-EA4 and LA-EA1 adapters are not working. Tried it with the LA-EA4 on my Sony A7s and still no F-stop reading and I can see the info of all the settings on my LCD and EVF but can't see through the lens, just a blank screen. After fiddling with it (removing it and re-mounting it, nudging it) the lens kicked in and I could see through the lens but still no aperture reading.I didn't buy this for my E-Mount cameras but for my A77 mark II which hasn't arrived yet. So before I return this lens, I will give it a try with my A-Mount camera once it arrives next week....but still, this lens should work with the Sony E-mount cameras via adapter without all those hiccups.UPDATE: 5/12/2015I'm sure this is a great lens for the cropped sensor cameras but my copy didn't work. Not sure if it's bad QA or a lens software issue but I downgraded to 1 star based on my experience with the SIGMA lens and I wasn't able to take even one shot because in the end, every SONY camera I tried it on didn't even register the lens was there. My last try with the A77 mark II, the camera didn't even power on with this lens on it. I'm returning it and not going to even try for a replacement."
Bob Charlie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,Amazing!
Sam,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not for a full frame camera.,"I didn't realize that DC for Sigma means the lens is only compatible on a crop sensor camera. :( ai was really excited to find a sigma art lens at these focal lengths, but alas, I guess I will have to wait for one that works good on a full frame.The vignette on this lens is very strong at 18mm on a full frame camera, and doesn't begin to dissappear until around 24mm.The glass was still good quality and took great few pictures, but since I couldn't use it at 18mm like I desired, I returned it. I would definitely recommend this lens to someone using a crop sensor camera."
J. Greene,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice quality lens,"I bought this to use with my  Blackmagic Design Cinema Camera with EF Mount . It is a great match for the camera since it is both wide and fast. It provides a nice normal range for the BMCC's 2.3 crop. On an APS-C DSLR, this would make a great wide lens.There is very little chromatic aberration on this lens compared to a Zeiss Distagon 35mm f2.0 (yes, I'm comparing this lens to a Zeiss). It appears just as sharp as the Zeiss, too. The bokeh is quite smooth. It seems to sharpen up a bit at higher f-stops, but I can see using this lens wide open all the time.The lens seems to be solidly built. It is solid without being too heavy. The focus throw is a good distance and the focus ring is smooth -- just the right amount of resistance and very little play. The lens does not have hard focus stops, but the soft stops are ""hard"" enough so that it is easy enough to stop when you hit them."
Husaini A.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,Well the best lens to bring along to any event that has limitation in term of space.
Grant Porter,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,I love this lens. Super sharp images. Easy to focus and extremely versatile.
Steven Thistle,5.0 out of 5 stars,This lens is kickass!,"Recently bought this Sigma 18-35 F1.8 Art lens (Canon Mount) for my Lumix GH4 and connecting the two with my Metabones Speed Booster. I film a lot of weddings here in Cape Town, South Africa and I needed a lens that was good for ""run and gun"" shooting. After testing it out quite a bit and shooting a wedding with it, I was pleasantly surprised with just how sharp this lens is! Like.. WOW! I've been a big believer for a long time that zoom lenses just aren't the way to go, because you just don't get the image quality or the sharpness that you do with a prime lens. But this lens might be sharper than some primes that I've been using for a few years now!It is a rather heavy lens though, and coming from a place of using small film camera prime lenses like the Nikkor 50mm F1.8, It took awhile to get used to. But I can't fault the camera on its weight at all because with such a solid casing and that amount of glass elements inside, its so worth the extra weight for the image quality you get!Truly what makes this camera trump any other lens in its class is that beautiful F1.8. I mean for a zoom lens, this lens is FAST! This was a major sell point for me because the GH4's ISO performance is not the greatest at all with that tiny Micro Four Thirds sensor. This lens paired with my Speed Booster has made this lens a lowlight monster, with the ability to shoot more establishing wides at 18mm and beautiful cinematic close-ups at 35mm.I truly can't fault this lens at all after using it for quite a few jobs, and with such a reasonable price tag I can't think of any lens I'd rather want. So if you're looking for a lens that covers the basic focal lengths for a scene, great in lowlight, well built and reasonably priced, then look no further!"

ALEXEY VOLOVODENKO,5.0 out of 5 stars,Superb quality - just as expected,"It really delivers the sharpness you can read about in the reviews. Construction is good, feel is nice, controls convenient. May have slight problems focusing in low light but keep in mind it is not a problem of the lens, it is a problem of camera focusing in such condition where focusing is problematic but shooting is still possible.The nicest bokeh you can find on a crop-factor SLR."

A. Woodard,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sigma Scores A Home Run!,"I was lucky enough to purchase this lens during the first batch of shipments. I immediately put it to use for both still and video use with Canon EOS cameras. I honestly could not be more impressed with a lens. It does everything well, including fast accurate focusing, smooth manual focus and zoom. The build quality is outstanding. Even higher than most L series that I own, and very close to the Zeiss ZE line. It has a pleasing bokeh, and minimal vignetting at all focal lengths. During my last four wedding shoots, it is the only lens I have used during the entire reception. Please Note: this lens is designed for APS-C, or cropped sensor camera bodies.It is not compatible with full frame sensor bodies."
Jade,1.0 out of 5 stars,BELOW EXPECTATION,"This lens was below my expectation. I have used way, way cheaper lenses with better quality in terms of sharpness and just over all quality. Needless to say I was disappointed. I guess that will teach me never to trust the words of those money-hungry YouTubers. They'd straight up lie to you for those sponsored product plus. Its all about the sponsorship to them. This was money wasted. SMH"
Kamal Khairi,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best lens for APS-C,"Sharp, versatile, fastest zoom lens! Kudos to Sigma for making a great general zoom lens and did I mention it's sharp even wide open?"
Jim Smith,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great, except focus accuracy","Optically impressive. But the focus accuracy is hit or miss. I have to shoot more frames and play with composition to ensure that I get at least one shot that is focused correctly, and then crop it to what the composition should be."
tim velo,1.0 out of 5 stars,Complete waste for professionals,"Would work great for a crop frame sensor, but on a full frame, most of the focal length shows the outer lens mechanism. Not just a little vignette, but full corners clipped by the frame from 18 - 28 mm. Not sure why I would want to buy a lens that would be worth more than the crop frame camera it would work on. Stick with canon glass if you have anything above a 6D! I'm ashamed that they would even try to sell this as a professional lens."
Jodie Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great lens,I love this lens... i have captured amazing shots already...
Darth Rob,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Incredible lens, like buying multiple primes rather than one zoom","The image quality is exceptional and the lens is sharp even wide open. There's some blue fringing but nothing that can't be easily fixed in RAW processing, but I am just nitpicking now. The build is exceptional - the zoom and focus rings are buttery smooth and nothing like I've experienced yet. It's smoother than some L series I've handled. The HSM is super quiet and completely inaudible in normal noise level environment. One of the things that I was really impressed with was that this lens ships with its own case and hood. Even the case is well made and appears better than the case Canon ships with the L series. Canon stands to learn a lot on that front alone - it's ridiculous that Canon doesn't ship hoods with Non- L series lenses and charges an additional $50-100 depending on the lens for the hood.The minimum working length is around 12 cm making it fairly useful even for macro photography. The 9 bladed aperture gives excellent round bokeh. All in all, this could be an excellent walk around lens suited for equally well for Landscapes, Reporting, or Portraits. As far as a crop sensor goes, it really doesn't get better than this as far as lens to price ratio goes. FYI, DxO Mark ranked this as the best crop sensor lens they have reviewed yet.I've had this lens for less than a week now and these are my initial impressions. I will update this review after I've used it for a bit longer."
TheFyend,1.0 out of 5 stars,"4 hours of my life wasted, did nothing","Junk. Can't autofocus to save it's life. Tried on T5i, T6i, 80D.. used USB dock to calibrate... 4 hours of my life wasted, did nothing."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,The zoom capabilities are limited which I knew when I bought it (it's still better than nothing),"I have a Canon EOS 70d, and I bought this lens after reading reviews praising its versatility and quality. I was excited about its wide aperture and zoom capabilities. However, this lens can not focus!! All my photos turn out blurry, and as I have done more research, many people seem to have the same problem. The zoom capabilities are limited which I knew when I bought it (it's still better than nothing). The autofocus will not work with the camera, and the quality of my videos are terrible with this lens. The much cheaper lens that came with the camera is far better in quality than the Sigma. I am very disappointed in this product and would advise caution in your decision to purchase it. I know people have said buying a Sigma mount has improved the focus capabilities, but I am not willing to pay more money for a lens that should work in the first place."
KMan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow!,"When dxomark said ""[w]ith the introduction of this model, Sigma has the best performing zoom of its type,"" they weren't kidding.I've only taken a few pictures but you can get that dreamy blur look at 2.8. The sharpness is to die for and color is spot on.I'll update with photos later on."

jedcal,1.0 out of 5 stars,One Star,More than half of the photos taken on the 70d were out of focus
curious,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not as good as other reviews mentioned. Perhaps, I got a bad copy...","I was very excited when I was informed that the lens was available and I would get it in a few days. This excitement quickly turned into disappointment after taking a few shots with this lens.The first shot is very blurry. It is so bad up to the point that it is like out of focus. I said to myself: Ok, this was probably because the lens doesn’t have IS, and the shutter was just 50. So I increased the shutter speed to like 60, which is about 1.6 times the focal length of 35. The result is almost the same: the picture is very, very soft. I continued increase the shutter speed in the hope of getting a shot with a decent sharpness. Unfortunately, this didn’t come. Again, I said to myself: let me try it outdoor. Pictures that are taken outdoor are better, but I don’t get the kind of sharpness many other reviewers mentioned. The sharpness is just “ok”, nothing spectacular. I got better sharpness with my kit lens Canon 28-135, and much better sharpness with the Canon 17-55.Another deal breaker of this lens for me is the indoor focus speed. It lags quite a bit in focusing when trying to take photo indoor in the evening.On the plus side, the build quality is no doubt the top notch. The zoom and focus rings are so smooth, and the internal focus is definitely good in term of no dust will get into the lens through external barrel movement.Because of many great reviews of this lens out there, I wonder if it is because I got a bad copy."
S. Peter Lewis,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Yes, it surely is a ""bag of primes""","I've been a pro shooter for over 30 years and use primes almost exclusively. This lens equals or beats my primes in the same focal-length range. And with a 1.8 max aperture, it truly gives full frame bokeh on APS-C cameras. It's built like a tank, has very smooth zoom and focusing rings, and there is essentially no chromatic aberation, even wide open. Yes, the auto-focus can be spotty, but don't let that deter you: it's quite easy to fix with your camera's micro adjustments, and in live view and manual it's perfect anyway. This is just about the finest APS-C lens I have ever used. Sigma hit this one completely out of the park!"
Pete,3.0 out of 5 stars,Fun lens but with limitations,"As with all of Sigma's recent lenses, this one is very sharp throughout it's zoom range. Also like Sigma's recent lenses, the autofocus does hunt a little before acquiring the subject. It's not much of an issue, this is obviously not a sport lens, more of a street photography lens or wider angle portrait lens.I was hoping to also use this lens for video.... but I adapt my lens to a Sony body.... Adapting lenses for video is NEVER a good idea and I would not recommend it. The autofocus motor is constantly active with micro-adjustments and it makes a ridiculous amount of noise. I even tried with an external mic but it's still too much."
Mp Vision,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love love this lens!!!,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Oh how I love this lens! I rented it for an event where I was incredibly worried about the low light. Well this lens on My canon 70D and it was all heaven! I was so happy with it that I just had to get it. I did, 2 weeks later. This is now My go to walk around lens. I don't have any technicals for you, but I am here to tell you that this lens is absolutely amazing for video. This is My first Sigma Art lens and I am sure this will not be My last. Check out the video I rave about it there."
Hawki Pierce,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exceptional Lens ... Another winner from Sigma,"I had the opportunity to rent this lens to shoot a wedding with my, then new, Pentax K-3. I wanted something that I could use with natural light in both a Church and reception hall setting. After all I had read about this lens, it wasn't hard to choose it for this job.First of all, this lens is ground breaking in it's scope and design. There is nothing else like it when it comes to zoom convenience coupled with the ability to shoot below f2.0 and as sharp as any prime lens within it's range.This lens is quite sharp right from f/1.8 and is brutally sharp from f/2.8 on. I had zero problems with the focusing system and had only 4 shots from the entire wedding that were out of focus by any noticeable degree. Contrast and Color saturation were first rate and when it came to Post Processing, I had very little to do.The lens is a little heavy, but what exceptional glass isn't?The build quality is as good as it gets, with the materials used and the fit and finish being state of the art in all ways.Between my K-3's very quite shutter and the Sigma's HSM focusing system, I was never intrusive during the ceremony.I can't really speak to any of the other systems that this lens is available for, but when it comes to Pentax ... there is nothing else remotely like it available. I can easily recommend this lens to any Pentax user that is looking for a low light, wide angle lens capable of zoom convenience with the speed and sharpness of a prime.Pricing for this lens makes it one of the best values on the market for pro quality and performance."
Brian,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sset to a single focus point and aim that at an area of high contrast (like an eye)  or may seem out of focus,"I have it mounted on a Canon 7D2 and the image quality I am getting is incredible. When shooting wide open at F1.8 I find I must set to a single focus point and aim that at an area of high contrast (like an eye) if you let the camera pick its own area there is a good chance that things will appear out of focus. Not a problem with the lens just a product of shooting at f1.8. I recently took this into the Cathedral in DC and even in the basement crypt with very low light I was able to shoot wide open at f1.8 handheld and got some very good shots. (I found out that the cathedral does actually allow tripods, but the review is of the lens, not my ability to plan ahead). I have a sample photo below that shows the detail that is picked up. Likewise I added a photo from the Airforce Memorial in DC with a crop to show detail (it is a pano of two photos) and a close up of a stone carved head in a case to show how it throws elements out of focus.All these photos are because I don't think I can explain the detail this gets, there is a little bit of CA and Vignetting, but for the most part that is a one button fix. The light transmission is incredible, this is not just an F1.8 lens but it is also a T Stop 1.8. I was a bit nervous pulling the trigger on this lens, as I see a good few one star reviews talking about focus problems, I cannot speak to what those folks are seeing, it is possible that there are some dud lenses out there, but my personal suspicion is that a lot of the problems are due to depth of field"

primeguy,5.0 out of 5 stars,All APS-C user must have..... all around.,"I give 5 star because of the performance and the price range. it might be too early to give it a rating but I'm confidents I have a good copy.I will update my reviews later if needed.I have my eyes on this Art Lenses long before I decided to get the 18-35mm for my canon 7d. I got mine in the store at the big photo show and I have plenty of time to test it first out of the box before buying the lens. I bought the first lens I was testing. I did not bother to remove it from my camera and the store have no problem with it.Ok, here's my first observation of handling the lens on my camera. Beautiful Plastic Body and Nice to carry (weight is heavy for some but not for me), just imagine carrying 5 lens (18-20-24-28-3)5 in one. The motor is very quite and I'm very impressed (test video also). the Lens hood and the Cap are OK.Both adjustment ring are a little tight but very smooth.This will be my Walk around lens from now on and will be my back up for my 5D mk2,Done my focusing test at the store and the sales rep at the store was really helpful, they leave me alone. It probably take me 15 - 35 mins before I decided my purchase. I got my copy on the first box I tried. I did not purchase the USB Dock cause I think do not need it and it will not work on my Sig 85mm F1.4 also.... I'm lucky on this one too and this is on my 5d mk2 all the time.So, if you want this lens I suggest going to your local store and tried it first and learn how to perform focus test.One more I notice on this lens right away that really blow me away... is the manual focus (lens) is super sharp at F1.8. WOW! The auto focus work great also but maybe just me...the MF is much sharper. The draw back is that it was only design for the Crop Sensor. On Canon this lens will be (18)28.8mm to (35)56mm.This is a keeper lens."
GT,5.0 out of 5 stars,Game Changer Lens with my Canon 70D!!!,"I bought this lens Nov 2014. I am a very active event/party photographer and have taken 40,000+ shots with this lens. It is my pride and joy and just about never comes off of my Canon 70! Before purchasing this, my main lens was Sigma's 17-50 f/2.8, which I really LOVED because it took awesome pictures, had great autofocus even in low light, and the 17-50 range made it very versatile for nice short range shots! However, turns out I didn't know what love was until I bought my Sigma 18-35! I was a little hesitant to buy it at first since I already had a lens that covered short range shots, but the thought of possibly having the equivalent of 3 1.8 prime lenses in one made it very tempting. I was/am always looking for ways to improve my work, so I took the dive and it was one of the best investments I've ever made! Now, my old love (the Sigma 17-50 2.8) is used as a backup and never sees any action.However, it wasn't love at first use though. When I first received my lens in Nov 2014, it was spontaneously having focusing issues. Prior to purchasing this lens, I did read a few reviews from other people stating their Sigma 18-35 was having focusing issues with their Canon 70D and that it was hit or miss if you had gotten a good or bad copy. At times, I did feel like mine was one of the bad copies as my camera was very slow to focus (about 3 or 4 seconds) even in a well lit environment. I didn't want to go through the hassle of sending it back to Sigma for inspection and repair, so instead I bought the $60 Sigma USB dock to see if updating the firmware would fix the issue. Fortunately, after doing so my lens is now tack sharp and auto focus is extremely quick! Not only is it quick, but it is able to focus in extremely low light conditions, which is very important for me when taking pictures of people dancing when the lights are dimmed. You can also make micro adjustments with the front and back focusing using the USB dock, but beware- it isn't user friendly at all. You might as well work for Sigma if you are able to figure it out! Fortunately, I didn't have to make any micro adjustments and a simple firmware update was able to resolve my focusing issue with my 70D.I also really love the build quality of this lens. The feel and the grip of it just feels like you are holding something of really, really high quality. It is on the heavy side (compared to my 17-50 and other lenses), but it is something you will get used to. In terms of weight, you can't make everyone happy anyway. Too light, people will complain it feels cheap. Too heavy, people will say, well... it's too heavy. I say man up because the pictures that come out of it are truly amazing. On the bright side, my right bicep and forearm are now a tab bit bigger thanks to the weight of this lens lol.I do miss the extra range that my 17-50 offered, but I've adapted to it by just moving with my feet, which means I've also increased my cardio :)Thanks so this lens, I have no reason to upgrade to a $3,500 full frame camera. This lens is truly a hidden gem for crop sensor cameras. Definitely 5 stars all the way! Great work Sigma! Now, if you can please make a Sigma 18-200 f/1.8 EX DG OS HSM Macro Art lens, that would be awesome- and please price it under $1,000 :)"
S. Arora,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Crazy sharp, but...","The reviews are absolutely right; this is an extremely sharp lens; better than primes in this focal range. I used it for a year and a half.But, over time I began to feel this len lacks ""character."" The photos never pop off the page. On one trip to Africa I had this lens, and a ""fun"" camera: the tiny Coolpix A. now discontinued. I'd pull it out for a quick snapshot, and I consistently found myself liking its rendition over the Sigma.(Don't be surprised; on the internet you'll find serious reviewers saying the coolpix A's lens is better than most Leica lenses of that focal length. THough it is not quite as sharp as the Sigma.)Ultimately, I decided that I'd much prefer the coolpix A over the big Sigma lens + D7100 combo, plus it weighs 1/5th as much! So the Sigma is now sold. Sharpness isn't everything. An interesting lesson."
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,So sharp; so frustrating!,"TL;DR - you will need the calibration dock and to spend many hours fiddling with it.Do you like things that don't work out of the box, but can be made to (mostly work) after hours of customization/calibration? Then this is for you.I've tried this on a 7D and a 7D mark ii. On both cameras most images are completely out of focus prior to calibration. After calibration many pictures are in focus, but it is far from perfect.The lens is quite slow to achieve focus. For example, taking pictures of small children is almost pointless. Kids tend to move faster than the lens can focus, whereas my L lens keeps up.When the lens does focus the sharpness is really impressive. Color and absence of fringing are also impressive.Calibration took me ~3 hours in the first session, and another hour a day later to refine. ...and then two more hours a couple weeks later to address a couple ranges that were consistently front focused.If you are willing to buy the lens calibrating dock, spend a fair bit of time calibrating, and mostly take pictures of slow or stationary things, then this lens is fine.If I could do it over I'd spend more and get a Canon L."
two dachshunds,5.0 out of 5 stars,What can I say?,"Not sharp enough to out- resolve a 24 megapixel sensor but close enough..... Closer than any Nikon lens will take you.I have Sigma 18-35 on backorder with Adorama that I will have to cancel and I will never do business with those morons ever again. Adorama is going to send me a check for $560 for 4 Nikon lenses (16-85mm, 50 1.4D, 85 1.8G and a kit lens 18-55) – after promising me $800 only hours earlier."
Loreley,2.0 out of 5 stars,Out of focus most of the time,"Let's start with the positives. This lens has amazing sharpness and its focal length and constant aperture are huge pluses for me. The build quality is excellent.The downfall of this lens is that the autofocus is completely garbage. I shoot with a Canon 7D and without tweaking anything via the Sigma USB dock, I'd probably get about 80% of images out of focus. With hours of tweaking using the USB dock, it performs better but it's far from reasonable (1 fail in every 3 or 4 shots).I would not recommend getting this lens unless you plan to use manual focus or live view focusing (slow!). The only thing holding me back from giving this 1 star is that I'm still hoping a magical firmware appears one day a that will fix all the AF issues (2018.06.12 still doesn't fix it)."
Jonathan,2.0 out of 5 stars,If it could only focus properly....,"This lens has trouble focusing on the Canon 70D. 85% of my shots were out of focus so I had to return it. Also, this lens is simply too heavy. The build quality is outstanding. The colors and bokeh are beautiful. It's a very promising lens but it needs a diet and more accurate focusing. Even at small apertures and very fast shutter speeds it was almost impossible to capture a sharp image."
Conrad,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not as good as all the hype.  But still impressive.  No in lens stabilization.,"I bought this lens with a MetaBones Speedbooster for my micro four thirds camera.It is bright and sharp. No in lens stabilization. It is also the noisiest auto-focus on the planet, and slow focusing, IMHO. Why? I am really, why does it have to SO NOISY! For video with manual focus, I found it difficult to keep the image sharp with large aperture. If you are film maker and can retake over and over until you master pulling focus for your scene, then great. But for spontaneous video, which I shoot. I found it difficult. I have some fast primes that focus like lightning, and the results are superior, no question about it. I lose too much video to the trash can with this lens. So I'll probably sell it. I will test it a bit more first, because there is a certain appeal to it related to it's speed.A few facts. Used with my .64 Metabones Speed Booster, the focal length is 26.5-51.5mm, and by gaining 1 1/3 stops it becomes an f/1.1 lens. A marvel! I have a native lens 12mm f/1.4, 25mm f/1.4 and a 42.5mm f/1.2, all this extremely fast auto-focus, so do I need the zoom? Do I need the extra bit of brightness? In dark situations, or for bokeh, maybe. Maybe not. I have plenty of zooms that cover wider ranges in brighter conditions. Unless I want that bokeh, which I can get with my primes. And that is exactly what makes it so hard to focus. Which means I need to stop down a few stops to open up the depth field. So you see what I mean, the big advantage of this lens is nullified. By the way, the zoom motion was not all that smooth and is something you would need to practice. So if you want this to be your only lens, practice constantly. Even so I think you may be dissatisfied with the focal lengths and want something wider at times. I didn't find the range of the zoom all that useful. 26.5-51.5mm? It may be different for your application as this lens was designed for a variety of crop format camera. In any event, for me, it is way too narrow a band for a zoom, and of limited usefulness. I think my fix focal length primes would work better, and zooming is overrated for video. Fixed focal length, steady shots, several angles and lenses would work better. Perhaps at fixed focal lengths and perfect focus. I'm thinking my f/2.8 zoom might be fine if I every need zoom for video (doubtful) or even one of my power zooms, coupled with my fast primes are sufficient.Why haven't I sold it yet? It has to do with the Speed-booster I use it with to mate up to my Micro Four Thirds Panasonic cameras. I have a GH4, and a GX85 with IBIS. Each camera has it's advantage--the GH4 for video, and the GX85 for image stabilization.Speed-booster: You are supposed to gain 1 1/3 stops of light using a Speed-booster with this lens. It's the reverse of a tele-converter. A 1.4x tele-converter loses one stop, a 2x tele-converter loses 2 stops--if you know the math behind apertures. The Speed booster give you back that light by concentrating it on a smaller sensor. You gain light. It's a miracle. So that makes this aperture f/1.1 which is exactly what my GH4 shows. Astoundingly fast. And it is true. I was shooting a f/1.1 with this f/1.8 lens. I compared it at the top end 51.5mm on a GH4 against a 50mm prime, both at f/1.4 and the exposures were 1/5 of a sec compared to 1/6 of a second, essentially dead nuts right on. Some people say you have to apply a crop factor to the aperture. I don't find that to be the case in the real world. So you can see, I'm going to test this lens out more thoroughly before I consider selling it. I love low light photography. It gains 2/3 of a stop over my 25mm lens, and 6/10 of a stop on my fastest, sharpest prime Not all that much of a difference. And those two lenses take up less space than this lens. Most likely I will be closing down this lens slightly in any event, which nullifies the speed advantage. I will definitely keep the speed booster, and think about the lens. I bought it for the Canon mount, because I anticipate buying Canon glass in the future.Final thoughts: I like the Canon mount. I'd like to start to acquire some Canon glass so that when the make the camera I want, in a few years, I'll have the glass before I buy the body.NOTE: Pictures show both camera bodies and the mating Speed Booster Interface."
Chris Basden,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome Lens!,"I'm primarily a video shooter. The value in this lens is simply unparalleled! It's been said in every product review out there, but there's just not another option if you need a fast, wide zoom lens for crop-body cameras. I'm using with an 80D, but I'll have this lens long after that camera's dead and gone. I plan to upgrade to an EOS R (Full frame, but you can use this lens with that body in crop mode) eventually, but as ""outdated"" as my 80D is, I'm getting great results using this lens. This is a no-brainer buy!"
Brittany U,5.0 out of 5 stars,How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.,"I just cannot say enough positive things about this lens. This was probably the most expensive lens I've ever bought, I try to buy used and otherwise hunt for deals on lenses that are ~300 or less, so needless to say I was a little hesitant to drop $800, but man was it worth it. This lens performs as if it were three times the price at least. I've always been a fan of wide-angle images, and on my 35mm camera I loved the way my 28mm 2.8 created the perfect mixture of depth but gave that ""context"" of a wide angle, something you lose with telephoto lenses. This lens is sharp, collects amazing light, has beautiful color, has a great build quality... I can't say enough things. My favorite lens."
thatmanphil,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it! (it's kinda big),"The first thing you'll notice about this lens is that it's big and heavy. People say it's like owning three fast primes in one; i say it's also like carrying three fast primes in once. Attached to my 80d I find myself holding the kit buy the lens instead of the body. But it's well worth the fast aperture and image quality. Even shot wide open at f1.8 pictures are very sharp and predictable. Don't let the limited zoom range put you off, 18-35 is extremely useful and is perfect for street photography, travel, events, and portraits. With this lens you really can get a pro level look to your images. The full time manual focus is the icing on the cake here, and i find myself preferring to focus manually at times.The only con is it's size. The lens hood just has to come off if it's going in the camera bag.p.s. I did have to adjust the autofocus micro adjustments in my camera to get accurate focusing as it had some serious front focusing issues."
Mason G. Williams,5.0 out of 5 stars,Inspired a love for photography,"My wife and I had purchased a Canon Rebel T3i about 3 years ago and after the initial excitement of owning a DSLR camera wore off, the camera spent the majority of that time in the closet next to it's box. The images just didn't pop like we expected them to. After learning a little bit about photography (aperture priority mode is your friend!) we decided to bite the bullet and get a good lens and let me tell you the difference between this lens and the kit lens is night and day. The colors are vivid and the images pop straight out of the camera.We took the lens to Europe with us in September and then to Vietnam this spring and we absolutely treasure the shots we got with it. The bokeh it produces is amazing and the fact that you can hold the 1.8f throughout the entire focus range really makes a big difference! None of these photos received any editing.I cannot recommend this lens highly enough as it turned us from iPhone photographers to artists. You will not regret purchasing this lens."
Tyson Hunsaker,5.0 out of 5 stars,The workhorse of workhorses,"Sigma Art 18-35mm is legendary for a reason. This lens is shockingly sharp and fast throughout the aperture and zoom range. It's beautifully renders the image and the craftsmanship and build quality is stellar. Sigma takes care of their art lenses and its obvious their more affordable lenses in the Art series lives up to the name of Sigma. This lens doesn't however have image stabilization so be aware of this. It's also very sharp and ""clinical"" as some have called it which means it doesn't have much ""character"" so be aware. I personally love that in a lens so it's perfect for me."
Lens Therapy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Masterpiece by Sigma,"A little about me, I do photography part-time and I normally shoot on my D7100. I like to play with different brands and have used Tokina, Rokinon, and Tamron, along with my Nikon and Sigma lenses. The amazing quality of this lens has stopped me from moving up to full frame.I have multiple primes but due to the performance of this lens I have stopped using them, It's such a pleasure to use. It's on the heavier side but once you get used to the heft you wont want to take it off your camera body. The quality of the photos are amazing, you can get creamy bokeh comparable to some full frame cameras. I used it recently at a family party and a quick headshot of a friend turned out so great it's going on his Christmas card. You wont be disappointed by this masterpiece by Sigma."
Competitive runner from DC,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Well built well constructed lens, but has focus problems with Nikon DX bodies","This lens is fantastic except for one major problem: it is not calibrated correctly for Nikon bodies. This lens consistently misses focus, regardless of aperture. On manual focus, you will see how sharp it is. But on auto focus - center spot - it misses focus at least half the time."
Baffmasta,5.0 out of 5 stars,BEASTLY LENS,"This lens is amazing. I have it paired with the sony a6500, but have used it also with the sony a7III and also the sony SF5.I would recommend this to anyone looking for a sharp lens with both wide and close range of shooting.I have had mine for 4 months now and would not trade it for the world."
Erick Breneman,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this lens,"Got this from another vendor, as my wife wanted to get for Father's day and it was backordered here. Heavy, but needs to be to get that f/1.8 across the range of zoom. I love this lens. It acts like a prime lens for quality, crisp clean images. Having the ability to take a picture of an entire house from the sidewalk on the same side of a street, or an entire side of a car that is only 10 or so feet away is awesome. The little bit of zoom to 35mm (56mm equivalent on my canon t4i) is a great normal eye-width view. I've only had for a few weeks, but it rarely leaves my camera.I have a 40mm pancake prime f/2.8 that is super small and great, but it ends up being a little too narrow of a view for a any indoor use, great for when outside and walking around. This lens is almost that long, but goes so much wider. The other lens I have is the 18-135mm kit lens, which is 3.5-5.6 and is only really useful outside, or inside on a bright sunny day, without going up to 1,600 or higher ISO.If you have some extra cash and your looking for a good indoor (or anywhere) lens, don't be afraid to stretch your budget if you are thinking of spending less. You will get a lot of use out of this lens."
alexw,5.0 out of 5 stars,Genuinely stupendous,"I cannot recommend this lens enough. I would probably buy it at $1000, it's that good. And the only reason for the discount over other L glass is that 18-35 is a somewhat limiting range. Everything you get within this lens' capabilities though is absolutely without compromise. Wide open at 18mm?Flawless results. Wide open at 35mm? It's like you're shooting full frame with a pro quality 24-70 2.8. Stopped down anywhere in the range? Great stars. Shooting straight into the sun? Classy, not overwhelming flares. It's absolutely wonderful at everything it does, and if you find compromises, you're looking much too hard in the corners off-axis wide open against a brick wall.If you can handle nailing focus at f/1.8 (and it does take skill), you will get nothing but fantastic results from this lens."
Kamk,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great lens, but very heavy.","I've only had the lens for 1 day, but I think so far the quality is wonderful. I was able to get a shot of all the food on our table from my seated position, and take some nice, crisp closer shots. I wish I could take off half a star because this lens is extremely heavy. I use this with my Sony A6400 + Sony A to E mount adapter + the lens and it weighs almost 7lbs."
Christopher,3.0 out of 5 stars,Lens is physically longer than I wanted,"I should have read the physical dimensions before purchasing. The lens is too long for my situation. The photos I took with it are high quality, but it's just a little too bulky for me to actually use on a regular basis."
Majstor,1.0 out of 5 stars,BUYER BEWARE: Returned product - known auto focus problems,"I returned the product, because the auto focus is non-existent and always miss-focuses. Front AND sometimes back focuses randomly (tested it extensively with view-finder and live-view). Just look it up online and you will find other people having the same issue. I used mine with a Canon 80D. Only buy if you're using exclusively manual focus for video and/or photo."
Dennis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Superb!,"Superb Lens! I use this with my D7200 and it's an excellent pair for taking photos of events, landscapes, etc. It's not much of a portrait lens due to it's short focal length; ie does not flatter appearances as subjects appear slightly wider than they actually are. However, for my needs, it's perfect! I bought this off Adorama and for the same price on Amazon; I received a sigma docking station for free. Fortunately for me, my lens did not need to be configured as the front and back focusing were good. The free sigma docking station is very useful however for future sigma lenses, and I do intend on purchasing more from this brand considering how well they've made the Sigma 18 35 1.8."
Abi,5.0 out of 5 stars,its a very good lens with fantastic IQ and sharp,"its a very good lens with fantastic IQ and sharp.,just the limited range and a little bit of sound while auto focus in video and hence have to use an external mic.,it can replace 4 primes in your bag.,28,35,50 and maybe a macro .,nothing like this out there."
Mister M,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible AF performance,"I just got this combo and i did adjust the lens in-camera already. Everything was working perfectly fine and getting sharp images. Last week I shot at my kid's school play in the auditorium. The lights were turned off for the entire show and only with the spot lights toward the stage. No problem, ALL my photos came out perfectly focused and sharp.Today, we had another show at the same place but this time with those ugly auditorium lights turned on and with no spot lights and after seeing my photos in lightroom LOTS of the photos are front focused. What the heck?! I mean, I clearly had the focus point on the person on the stage standing still, but the person in front approximately three stinking yards away was in focused. how did that happen? Well, from what I have been told this lens behaves this way in different types of artificial light.Again, this clearly does not look like a calibrating issue and I know I don't need the hub, and I'm certain is not the D500 doing that. This to me is not good at all. I honestly cannot comprehend how sigma is selling garbage like this, to me this is completely unacceptable. I'm giving sigma two thumbs down. I'm really really disappointed because i thought this lens was THE perfect choice for the amazing D500. What a major let down.Thank god I didn't do any paid jobs with this lens, that would have been a nightmare and I'm glad I caught this issue on time to return it."
Veritas,4.0 out of 5 stars,It would have been a perfect DX lens...but...,"I bought this lens to use in my Nikon d5300 which was my backup camera for a trip to Thailand. It worked BEAUTIFULLY. Awesome wide angles, with crisp images and great color saturation.Now why 4 stars instead of 5: you'll NEED to work very hard to make this lens work as intended.First, you need to start with a camera that came with a well tuned Auto Focus off the bat. As it turns out my d5300 did. Nonetheless, I spent a good 1+hr calibrating the lens using the Sigma USB adapter (so add $60 to the cost of the lens).But, if your camera has AF problems out from the factory, you are out of luck again. I recently bought a refurbished d7100 and I was getting awful out of focus images with this lens, even with the best light.After much internet research and testing, I figured that AF issues are a common cause of returned cameras that end up being sold as refurbished. Hence, I ended up spending another non-trivial amount of time fine tuning the AF system for this and all my lenses. Now I feel is half decent. Will need to run more tests to compare the performance between the d5300 and d7100 after the AF adjustment. I certainly would not want to re-run the lens calibration because at least I know it works fine with the d5300.Bottom line, many of the negative reviews here are likely from folks that did not know that they needed to spend a tremendous amount of time calibrating this lens and your camera, or both, to work properly. If you are one of those, make sure you buy brand new, non-refurbished, cameras or buy same brand name lenses (at a higher price tag of course).UPDATE Nov 2015: I got a different d7100 body and went through the whole recalibration process again. Love the results, BUT I just can't manage to get autofocus to work at 18mm wide open. With any other length it is sharp as a tack, it is just at 18mm that it get blurry results focusing to infinity. Did I get a bad copy?"
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing sharpness and lens, but adjustments needed.","I bought this lens from a vendor not on amazon but I’m very happy with this lens! It is incredibly sharp and probably one of the sharpest lenses for and APS-C camera at the moment. With it being at 18-35mm, it doesn’t have much range but it is great from landscape photography, and I use it as an unconventional portrait lens at 35mm. If you are worried about bokeh, it is just buttery smooth. You may have to buy the sigma dock to do some focus adjustments as I found my copy to front focus a lot at first. Once you get the adjustments in, it is just amazing. Shooting into direct sun it doesn’t have too much chromatic abberation and only some glaring but it’s not too bad. This lens does really well in low light as well. It is definitely a more expensive lens for APS-C cameras but I say after lens adjustments it is a highly capable lens. I didn’t give 5 stars because of the slight focusing issue but other than that I would say it’s worth the buy!"
"Chris from Edmond, OK",1.0 out of 5 stars,BEWARE - Autofocus Issues renders this lens worthless.,"Used with a Canon 7d Mark II. 4 out of 5 shots fail to focus correctly. Close enough to look sharp and fool you in the viewfinder...but disappointment is waiting for you once you view full size. All those amazing shots you thought you got were actually ruined.The large aperture on this lens is great, right? That does mean a shallow depth of field, however. Trust me...you'll see just how shallow it is when the lens front focuses every single one of your shots by a couple of inches.I exhausted my return window believing I was doing something wrong. Maybe I was shaking the camera, or using the wrong AF point? I finally got fed up and set up a test rig with tripod and a focus test chart. Unfortunately, it is the lens...Google ""Sigma 18-35 front focus"" See if this is something you want to risk dealing with.Don't lose your money on this! If you bought this lens and think you must be doing wrong (considering all the glowing reviews), don't be fooled! Return it now...don't wait a couple of months before you realize it really is the lens causing these problems."
B. W. Sharp,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My ""Go-to"" lens for almost every situation!!","I have now had this lens for about 6 months and it just keeps getting used more and more. I used it to shoot a concert last night in really poor lighting and not a single good angle. This was the only lens for this environment, it delivered sharp pictures in very low light. I use a 7D and the lens is not treated well by me as I walk around it still looks like the day I bought it. This is my first Sigma lens but it won't be my last based on this model. Only con I can think of is that it is very heavy and it does not focus lightning fast when moving but is very quick on fixed objects. Highly recommend to anyone shooting with a APS-C sensor."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awsome Lens......Absolutely no regret buying it over Canon 16-35 F4,"Used it for trip to Torres Del Payne, Chile and OMG I stuck with it with Canon 60D....fantastic lens. Why can't Sigma make it as FF?? Please Sigma make FF version and I am willing pay more than what you were charge right now, seriously.I returned Canon 16-35 F4 and chosen to keep this one instead even it is made for APS-C. Sharpness, almost no CA at F1.8, and building quality are the main reasons that I decided to keep this one over Canon 16-35 F4."
bryan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Game on,"Probably the best lens I have yet to use for a crop body camera. Solid and very well constructed, impressive. The focus ring and zoom ring both rotate firm and smooth, no clunking around. Auto focus is fast and accurate, no in-camera adjustments needed. I use this on the Canon 7D (MK I) and strongly believe I just ""upped"" my game as far as professionalism and quality is concerned.Thank you Sigma for making such an excellent lens.... PLEASE do something like this for the 2.8 class 70-200 or higher.-Chicago"
NY's,5.0 out of 5 stars,Go ahead and buy it.....it's an amazing lens.,"I have been using this lens for the last 3 weeks and so far it has exceeded my expectations. Even nikon lenses don't have the image sharpness that this provides. Performs better than my nikkor 50mm. Don't debate...buy it. It is a keeper.Cons: slightly heavier than other lenses, Not telephoto and no VR...but in my experience I didn't miss the VR feature at all. The lens is producing just awesome and sharp pictures what else to say. Amazing low light performance, beats the nikkor hands down."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,World's fastest zoom nears perfection,"The fastest zoom lens ever made, Canon and Nikon owners have had access for a while. As of July 2014, Pentax shooters can get one, too - which I did. And I am very, very happy about it. This lens will be on my camera probably 80% of the time.First, the bad news: 1) It's heavy, and mounted to my K-3, it's a beastly combo. I'll live with it. 2) I wish they could have engineered this quality into an 18-50 or thereabouts. (This is probably impossible...but then, this lens seems impossible.) Usually I can just get a little closer to the subject if needed, so it's not such a hardship. 3) It is prone to lens flare, so shots that include a bright sun can be challenging. This one is a bit irritating, but I have another lens I can use in such situations if need be. And after all, most of my work doesn't feature a mid-day sun. Because of these things, if I could grade it 4.5 instead of 5, I'd do that. But it's too good to rate a 4.Beyond that, all news is good! The image clarity from this lens is superb - near perfect at center, and very good even at the edges and corners. What's more, that statement holds true across the focal range, and at any aperture, even wide open. Beautifully crisp at 35mm, it's even better at 18 and, as you might expect, best around the middle of its range.Construction is very solid with both the focus and zoom rings moving smoothly and holding position once set. Autofocus can be fine-tuned manually without switching to manual mode, and the lens length never changes. (Focus and zoom actions happen entirely inside.) Nor does the outer ring rotate, making polarized filters easy to use.Vignetting and CA's are modest, and stopping down slightly will all but eliminate them. Barrel distortion and pincushion are to be expected with any zoom, but it's controlled and I'm sure a Pentax corrective profile will soon be available for Lightroom 5 users. (It's already there for Canon and Nikon versions.)While no lens is perfect, this one comes closer than any zoom I know of, and it's on par with the best primes in this focal range, making them redundant. Portraits, landscapes, street shooting - this is a versatile, very high quality lens.Sigma has come a long way in this business, and they've now asserted themselves as innovation and quality leaders. Yet somehow, they still price like a ""value"" player. I love this lens and I'm becoming a big Sigma fan, too."
Daryl,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice lens,Pic with nikon d3400. Left was just playing with lightroom and right is straight fr the camera.
Nic,4.0 out of 5 stars,"GREAT FOR PHOTO, NOT NECESSARILY FOR VIDEO","The picture quality is phenomenal and especially impressive in low-light (as many have mentioned).It performs superbly as three prime lenses in one.I took off a star because of its inability to auto-focus well on my 70D. The quality is still there, but the AF is not nearly as quiet as the Canon and it can skip frames while you're moving around when the camera is trying to auto-focus. It also lacks image stabilization. I did a comparison to the Canon 18-55 mm STM w/ IS lens that my 70D came with and when it comes to shooting video in motion, the Canon wins by a mile; not on picture sharpness or quality, but on the fact that you can actually watch the video without any skips or shaking.As far as bang for your buck, it's hard to beat the Sigma 18-35mm F1.8 HSM lens for photography, but if you're looking for a good lens for shooting video, this might not be for you."
Jeffrey,2.0 out of 5 stars,Autofocus issues.,"Possibly the worst autofocus of all time, but images are crisp and clear. I shoot on the Canon 7D, perhaps it is my own camera with issues, but my other lenses work fine."
stevenj2,3.0 out of 5 stars,Build quality good. Focus is the issue,Large and heavy for APSC. Build quality good. Focus is the issue. Send mine today 9-14-16 to Sigma on Long Island with a Pentax body to calibrate.The only way to insure good focus is ..you should set up camera body to use back button focus. Look it uo if you did not know to D-Link shutter button to focus. Use live view plus back button focus ..after it locks focus you may like to shu live view off to check framing thru the viewfinder. Use this method anyrns gives you front or back focus problem. It takes the focus sensor out of the procesd.Hope you know thT DSLR have a separate focus sensor.Anyway Iike the Sigma but as I've spent too much for also Pentax 20-40 f/2.8-4.0 Limited plus a Pentax DA* 26-50 f/28 plus a Pentax 35 f/2.8 macro limited. which all feel different..the Sigma is secondary choice to use.
Christopher R. Vickers,5.0 out of 5 stars,The church had the worst lighting ever,"I was taking pics at a church during a wedding.The church had the worst lighting ever.I remembered that i purchased this lense a few days ago. I was desperate. My 24-70 and 28-75(Both 2.8) weren't cutting it. I then tried this lense. It did a very good job.However, you have to get somewhat close to the person your taking pictures of.Its a well built lense, but it is heavy.The F 1.8 makes a world pf difference"
Anonymous,5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased with ND filter - Perfect for film!,"Bought this lens mainly for videography. Being completely new to the game, when i tried to record in broad daylight I was dissappointed because I could not record at F/1.8 without raising the shutter. However I purchased an ND filter and problem solved! Loving it so far. Also great for photography!Here's a link to a video if you'd like to see test footage of the lens with ND filter!youtube[dot]com/watch?v=EsayGhcBnywAlso if you're curious the ND filter I purchased was: B+W 77mm ND 1.8-64X with Single Coating (106)"
Jinzei,5.0 out of 5 stars,Legendary!,"This is an amazing lens like everyone says. Not really much to complain about optically, focuses really fast like a native lens. I had to get mine slight calibrated, though. My only major complaint is that it weighs like a tank. Prepare to get some nice bicep curls."
efl,4.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful Portrait Glass At A Good Price Point,For the price it is definitely on par with the Canon equivalents. I am using this on a 7d Mark II and my only complaint is the focus does hunt just a little longer than I would like but it's still pretty darn quick. Considering it's meant to be a superb portrait piece of glass - the little slower focus isn't a deal breaker. Bokeh is solid and the DOF at 1.8 is beautiful. Rent it first of course - but you'll love it.

Chris,5.0 out of 5 stars,You buy it.  You buy it now.,"Bought local since I was wary of Sigma lenses in case I had to return it. Best lens I've ever owned, simple as that. Incredibly sharp and fast. The focus is smooth. The build quality is like a tank... which is also its only downside, it's REALLY heavy. If you're not self conscious about toting around such a large lens, it makes for a perfect indoor low-light lens."
David Wang,5.0 out of 5 stars,Prime lens image quality for a zoom lens,"This lens is amazing, the quality you get for your money is unbelievable. For about 900$ you get to basically cram the Canon 20mm, 24mm, 28mm, and 35mm prime lenses into one convenient body (which would all together cost about 5000$). This lens is Canon L lens level image quality, often even surpassing the Canon lenses in terms of chromatic aberration, vignetting, color and sharpness. The bokeh is creamy and beautiful, and the f/1.8 capability adds great low-light versatility. The focusing is also fast and quiet, and you can tweak it with the Sigma USB dock if you so desire. Furthermore, the build quality is amazing and you can expect it to last you for a long time. The only downside I would say is the weight, it's quite hefty but what do you expect for zoom lens with a wide aperture.In general, this is a very versatile walk-around lenses that creates beautiful results. If you want Canon L lens quality without the price tag, this is the lens for you. It was money well spent."

So after spending 900CAD, I've got to spend close to $100 to make it accurate... this is very frustrating as I thought the usb dock was delivered with the lens"
Bren,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice sharp lenes but heavy,"I must say this lenes is the whole package when it comes to sharpness and quality. I use it primarily for video on my 70D, The two problems I must say is it's pretty heavy alone and don't even mention adding other equipment. The other problem I encountered is the focus jumping in and out at times for no reason, I best suggest you MF for video. For pictures it's great especially in low light and dead sharp the auto focus is fast, smooth, and quiet. Other than that I would recommend this lens 100%"
Alexander Rau,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Lens. 3 Prime Lenses in one. Great focus Ring.,"This is the first time i leave a review for a product on Amazon. I found out about this lens by accident. I was looking for a good f2.8 zoom lens and read in all kinds of forums about f2.8 lenses from Sigma, Tamron and Canon.In one of the forums someone mentioned a 15-35mm f1.8 from Sigma and i though he might have mistaken and it was a f2.8 not a f1.8. But I gave it a try and did a search on Amazon for this lens and sure enough there it was.My biggest concern was the focus ring. My other Sigma (18-55 f2.8-3.5) has a very loose, short distance focus which makes it difficult to pull my own focus when I am filming. The local camera store did not have this lens in stock, so i could not try it out. Looking at some reviews and videos I gave it a try and ordered this lens.First impression:- Lens is build like a tank. No plastic crap. All metal. Very robust- Focus ring almost a half turn. With SOFT stop. No hard stop and loud click when you reach the end. I love the focus ring. Well done, Sigma- Zoom Ring the same, smooth and easy to find with your fingers.- F1.8 is great. Where can you find an 18mm lens with an f1.8?- This lens gives you 3 Prime lenses in one. 18mm, 24mm, 35mm. Saves you money.- Very close focus. I can get to an inch close to an object and still focus.i shot my last video for a client with it and loved the lens. Great for Video.Other thoughts. The lens is heavy. It was build to last and that is OK. I can feel the weight of the lens at the end of the day. Not a huge negative, because quality is heavy. My Tamron f2.8 is lighter, but the focus ring and build is not even close to the quality of this lens.This lens is cheap, compared to getting 3 canon prime lenses. Bonus is you don't have to swap lenses.With this lens and my Tamron 24-70mm f2,8 I can film everything. i basically only switch between these two lenses. My pack got lighter and I have space to take other things with me."
Gatorowl,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Replaces Multiple Primes, But Does Have AF Issues Wide Open","This is one of the sharpest lenses I have ever used. It's pointless to compare it with other zoom lenses. Rather, it competes with the better prime lenses. However, it is not perfect.My copy has AF issues. At apertures larger than f2.8 it is neither consistent nor accurate. The deviance from accuracy ranges from minor to quite substantial (i.e., noticeable at normal viewing size). I tested on both a D7100 and a D800E. The D800E was a bit better (when it missed, it didn't miss by as much or as often).Liveview focusing was far more accurate, and I could see how good the lens is at all aperture values (it's amazingly sharp at f1.8). No AF problems at smaller apertures (f2.8-f8). The lens truly sings at these aperture values. When in focus, the resolving power is amazing. Microcontrast is indeed lower at larger apertures. However, it was very difficult for me to detect any difference in detail resolved when stopped down. Contrast and color improved on stopping down (it really seemed to peak at f5.6), but I did not detect additional detail.The lens performs incredibly consistently across the entire zoom range. Edges really do not lose much sharpness compared to the center. Others have noted that the lens is strongest at distance at the wider end of the zoom, and stronger close up at the longer end. However, my testing was not sophisticated enough to detect such nuances. I suspect most would not be able to discern differences.Zooming and manual focusing rings are nicely damped. Definitely not too sticky or rigid as others have experienced.So, what to do about the flakey AF wide open? I'd love to deduct half a star. However, given that this zoom blows away all other lenses at f2.8 and smaller apertures--i.e., this is the best f2.8 zoom available for the D7100--, I consider the larger aperture values a bonus. I can shoot manual for critical situations requiring wide-open shooting, so I don't consider the AF issue major enough to deduct any stars. I also have hope that Sigma might address the AF issue in a future firmware release.All-in-all, this is an amazing lens. While the zoom range is a bit tight, it most definitely replaces prime lenses in its range."

Danny,5.0 out of 5 stars,Unbeatable Value,"Yes, this is a big heavy lens. No, it isn't weatherproofed. No there is no OS/IS.

yahoouser,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Defective autofocus, OK picture quality, and a lot of hypes","Well I bought this lens during the ""hype"" of ""first Zoom lens with F1.8, and a few ""reputable"" youtube channels seem cannot say enough about the good things of this lensIt turns out to be a huge disappointment.1) The auto focus of this lens at video mode is totally not working on my Canon T5i, I can hear the motor struggling for 5,6 second and end up somewhere completely out of focus. Have tried the firmware update with dock, did not solve the problem.2) The famous back/front focus issue. I am not alone on this, but I do spend hours and hours to use the sigma USB dock (which costs me another $60) to micro-adjust the focus. The result is mixed, I am not sure that it gets any improvement. Still I had about 3 out of 5 close up pictures seriously off focus. (I am guessing the reason sigma ask for calibrate 16 points data is to fit in a model and correct the autofocus accordingly, but it is obviously not working very well)3) Picture quality, it is not bad but is it really as sharp as some of the sigma fanboys talked about? I don't think so.4) Usb dock, this has to be bought separately and again is not perfect ( for example, I can not upgrade firmware to latest version(1.0.2) because the dock keep displaying my lens firmware(1.0.1) is updated)Overall, sigma is using their customer as debugging tools in stead of doing their job.My recommendation: google ""auto focus"" problems before you buy this lens and better to test shot some and make your own judgement"

C. Heffernan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quick comparison with the Canon 17-55mm f2.8,"There are several in depth reviews available so I just wanted to add a few impressions after using this lens compared to to my Canon 17-55mm f2.8 IS lens since the two lenses might be competing for a spot in someone's camera bag.Advantages of the 18-35mm:Both are sharp lenses but the 18-35mm may have the edge. While the 17-55mm has IS, I prefer the wider aperture since it is also helpful for moving subjects and can provide shallower depth of field. The build quality of the 18-35mm is awesome and I love that the zoom is all internal. I worry sometimes when carrying my 17-55mm from a strap and it is swinging around with the zoom extended.Advantages of the 17-55mm:The 18-35mm auto focus is fast and quiet but seems to take a fraction of a second longer to lock than my 17-55mm, especially in low light conditions. Focus is accurate though. I have been using the Sigma 30mm f1.4 and compared to that lens, the 18-35mm lens seems to have more consistent results. Obviously the range on the 17-55mm is better and when comparing the two I miss the longer end for close-ups of people since even 35mm can look weird if you get too close.Overall this is a great lens, and for the price it is fantastic. Like most any lens, it still has a few trade offs though, so after all that, I can't say which lens I would prefer if I had to pick. I can say however that my 30mm f1.4 will be gone soon. This lens stands up well to the prime lenses in the 28-35mm range and for 24mm and below there is no competition."
Aleksa,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great lens, but when used with my Canon 70D ...","Great lens, but when used with my Canon 70D - both brand new, has serious focusing problems. Even after playing with in-camera lens correction, I couldn't make it to work."
Jason C.,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Sigma 18-35mm f/1.8 From an Astrophotographer's Perspective,"NOTE: This is a review for the Nikon mount of this lens mounted on a Nikon D7000, from an astrophotographer's perspective. The lens was rented from a local camera store, and I confirmed with them that I was the first customer to rent it. Therefore the review is accurately based on a new and unused lens as one would receive from Amazon.I recently rented this lens for a 5-night observing run on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. I primarily used the lens for astrophotography and night time lapses of the observatories. For an example photo, see the user image gallery photo of some of the observatories on Mauna Kea. So, when Sigma announced their 18-35 f/1.8 lens I was naturally very excited, given that I don't need VR and just need more light reaching my sensors. The prospect of using a wide angle, large aperture lens was something always desired when it came to night photography. Anyway, here are my experiences on the different aspects of this lens:Acutence: This lens delivers a remarkable level of detail straight at 18mm f/1.8. I pretty much only used it at this focal length and aperture, and this is where the lens definitely soars. In the months before the lens started shipping, there was speculation that the sharpness would have to be compromised for having such a large aperture. Nope, Sigma defied the odds and created a truly remarkable lens. There is definitely a loss of microcontrast at f/1.8, however this can be easily (mostly) brought back with a bit of sharpening in post processing. The actual detail that is resolved (and that cannot be recovered in post processing) is stunning; I have been able to resolve the guard rails about half a kilometer away at 18mm f/1.8. Checking the resolution figures on DxO or DPReview again confirms this, this lens is truly on a ""professional"" level when it comes to resolution.Lens Aberrations: One other characteristic that is touted about this lens is its relatively low levels of lens aberrations. For astrophotographers the worse lens aberration is coma. This aberration is when point sources of light begin to look like they are being stretched more and more in the radial direction the farther it is from the center of the image. Typically large aperture lenses are the worst offenders, however I'm happy to report that the Sigma 18-35 f/1.8 has minimal levels of this problem.BROAD DAYLIGHT AUTOFOCUS: This is where the lens performed the worst. The lens' autofocus was sometimes really off when photographing a high-contrast object in DAYTIME conditions; normally one would have to zoom in a little bit on the image to check focus, but for this lens I can tell without zooming in on the image that it was out of focus. This occurred probably about half the time, when I used the lens in DAYLIGHT situations. Note that when I did the tests I used very bright and/or high contrast targets, on the central AF point on my D7000, and the focus consistency was way off a lot of the times (poor precision as well as poor accuracy). Also the autofocus is very silent so no problems there.NIGHT TIME MANUAL FOCUS: Since autofocus was useless for my purposes, I MANUALLY FOCUSED using planetary calibrators, i.e. point sources in the sky, this didn't affect me as much. I say again: I did ***NOT*** use autofocus for my astrophotography photos.Physical Aspects: The lens itself is very well-built and sturdy, I feel like I'm holding a real optical instrument in my hands. The barrel is made of smooth metal, and the lens has a bit of heft to it that suggests it is a pro-grade lens. The rubber on the zoom and focus rings are also the perfect size. The focus ring is on the front while the zoom is on the back, which is how all pro-grade lenses are arranged. The filter size is 72mm which is slightly annoying since most pro-lenses use 77mm filters (and most of us can interchangeably use 77mm filters), but this is a very minor complaint. The zoom ring increases the focal length as you turn it to the right, which is how all Nikkor lenses are. However for the focus ring, infinity focus is reached by turning it to the *left*, which is the opposite from Nikkor lenses. This can cause slight confusion if you are used to Nikkor lenses (as I am). Both zoom and focus rings are very damped, a bit too much for me in fact. This actually gets worse in the cold (my camera sits in 0 C weather for several hours at a time), and both rings get even stiffer. Also the hood is provided and easy to use, but the lens cap was very difficult to put with the hood on or off, especially in the dark. If I were to buy this lens I would get a Nikon cap just because it is better designed and easier to use. The lens flange doesn't have any sort of weather sealing either which was a bit concerning in dusty environment (I wrapped my camera and lens in a plastic bag before deploying). Lastly the AF/M switch is very useful - when AF is on there is a bit of white behind the button so it makes it easy to check whether or not if your AF is on.Conclusions: This lens would be perfect if the autofocus issues were resolved (pun intended). For some purposes where AF is not required, then this lens would be perfect. It is possible that the copy I rented was a lemon, and that other normal copies work fine. Here are my pros and cons:Pros:- Impressive, uncompromised resolution at f/1.8.- Good control of coma over most of the frame, good for astrophotography.- Well built lens.- AF switch is painted so easy to know if AF is enabled or not.- Zoom ring turns in the same direction as other Nikkor lenses.Cons:- Autofocus has poor precision (consistency in hitting the same focus whether it is correct or not) and poor accuracy (hitting the correct focus in daylight conditions.- Coma is still quite evident towards very corner of the frame, may bother people who photograph point sources of light a lot.- Lens cap isn't the easiest to put on.- Focus ring turns in opposite direction from Nikkor lenses.- Zoom and focus rings are too damped for what I like, gets worse in the cold weather.- No weather sealing at flange.11/14/2013 Addendum: I've just noticed that the lens is free of coma except in the very corners of the frame. Stars (point sources of light) at the corner do exhibit noticeable coma, although this is still much better than say Nikon's 50mm f/1.4G at f/1.4. It looks more like a smearing in the meridional direction, than actual wings (see Ken Rockwell's 58mm f/1.2 Noct article for an example). For this reason I downgraded the review to 3 stars."

They should have mentioned this somewhere on the description.Upgrade to 4 stars because it is really solid and built just like the 35mm 1.4 Sigma which is a fantastic lens.

skater,,Sending lens back to sigma takes too long!,"Got this lens for my canon 80d. I noticed very soon that I was having focusing problems. I was hesitant to attempt to use the dock, so I sent the lens of to sigma together with my camera and they calibrated it for me. It now works really well and I'm very pleased.The reason I gave it 4 stars in stead of 5 is not because I had to send it off, not because I had to pay £30 insured postage (they paid for sending it back to me). The reason I gave it only 4 stars is the length of time it took. They held on to my camera for a week and a half! I cannot think what took them so long. Any one reading this is probably into photography and would understand the hardship of parting with a camera for so long."
Amazonian-001,,Brilliant lens image wise,Brilliant lens image wise. But do take the tiem look up Sigma's USB Adjustment dock first. My lens is massively out of focus using Autofocus (Front and back focusing massively infront of the subject) Used on a 7Dmk2. It's common in this lens which quite frankly is a massive let down knowing that. Looks like mine is just about correctable with the USB dock but another £40 down the drain... And customer service weren't exactly helpful with advice. Will have another crack at the adjustment to see if I can get it more consistent but I have a horrible feeling I'll have to ask for a replacement... Just all to bear in mind!
S. Evans,,This lens is brillaint,"I bought this lens as an upgrade from the 18-55mm kit lens on my Nikon D3300.I deliberated for months before buying this lens. I was looking for a lens that I could leave on the camera for most of the time, that had a bit more reach than the kit lens in both directions, was fast and light, had optical stabilization and was optically brilliant. There isn't such a lens, so then it was about where to compromise, which resulted in 'deciding' on lots of different lenses before this one.Prior to buying the Sigma, the Nikon 16-80 was ticking most of the boxes. However, when I looked at pictures taken with it on Flickr, they were good but nothing special. I upgraded to a Digital SLR from a compact because I wanted to take pictures that were wow, and the Nikon 16-80 wasn't going to deliver on that front. Before buying any lens, I recommend that you go to Flickr and check out pictures taken with that lens.I had been looking at just Nikon lenses, assuming that they would be best. Having not found a lens after many months, I went to DXOMark to check out how the third-party lenses compared. To my surprise, other than Carl Zeiss lenses, the sharpest lens they have tested on a D3300 is the Sigma 18-35, even beating the Nikon primes. The Sigma 18-35 failed to tick a lot of the boxes, it wasn't light, it didn't have the range I was after, and it didn't have optical stabilization. However, the pictures on Flickr looked fantastic, I wanted to take pictures that looked wow, so I ordered the lens. I then wondered if I'd made a big mistake.Firstly the concerns I had. The weight hasn't been a problem. The Sigma is a lot heavier than the kit lens, but the D3300 isn't that heavy so it hasn't been a problem having the two of them round my neck all day. The lack of reach hasn't been an either. I do not print my pictures, so with the pictures being as sharp as they are, I can crop them quite heavily and still have great results. The lack of optical stabilization is balanced by the fast F1.8 aperture to a large extent, although at F1.8 the depth of field becomes very narrow. I have used the lens indoors at the Harry Potter Studios and it worked just fine.Now the good stuff. I can't tell you how sharp this lens is, the pictures it returns are awesome. Going from my compact camera to the digital SLR was a big jump in quality. Upgrading the kit lens to this Sigma has been another big jump. Also, being able to open the lens to F1.8 has been more rewarding than I imagined. At F1.8, the progressive blurring can bring pictures to life.So should you buy this lens to replace the 18-55 kit lens? If you want to take pictures that are wow, this lens delivers big time. For me, having that quality outweighs its limited zoom range, weight and lack of stabilization. The F1.8 aperture gives you options for being creative with each photo you take, and it is great fun having it available; I would now take F1.8 with no stabilization over F3.5 or whatever with stabilization any day. This lens feels lovely in the hand and it is great fun to use. As an update to the 18-55mm kit lens, I am delighted with this lens and I thoroughly recommend it.A note about the auto-focussing. Some reviews of this lens mention problems with the auto-focussing. I don't know if this is something Sigma has improved on (most of the reviews were written when the lens was first released, about two and a half years ago now), but the auto-focus has been spot on for me."
Timothy Vashchyshyn,,PERFECT FOR BEGINNERS...,"Yes, that's right. I said it. It's perfect for a beginner. Now, don't look at the price and think that it's too much. Instead, look at it as an investment. I started with Canon Rebel T5i and i used nifty fifty (50mm) as my primary lens (shooting b-roll) because it had good DOF (depth of field). But then I found this one as my main lens. Oh Jesus, i can't put it down. It's a bit heavy with my new camera (80D) so i'm over the moon with my purchase.Money? save up for this one.Worth it? Of course.When to buy? Yesterday."
Vlad,,Excellent but massive lens,"I simultaneously really love this lens, and don't find myself using it too much.I bought this to use with my Canon EOS 200D. Optically, it's gorgeous. Really clean, sharp, plenty of room for cropping there as well. Beautiful out-of-focus areas when you're taking close-ups at F1.8. I've also taken some nice portraits with it, and I love the look it produces.Mechanically, it feels sturdy and well-built. The rings move smoothly, and all of the zooming and focusing is internal.What I like less is how large and heavy it is. I quite often found myself reaching for my second-hand and optically-inferior Sigma 17-70 C, instead. Overall, I'd say it depends on what you're going to use it for - I tend to take most of my photos while hiking, which this isn't great for, but if you're ok with the size and weight, it's a beautiful lens.More recently, I've switched to using a Sony A7R III, which happened to ship with a Sigma MC-11 adapter for EF lenses. For fun, I took the A7RIII + MC-11 + 18-35 on a walk, and was rather pleased with the results. Still sharp, still smooth. You need to use it in crop mode, but you still get 18MP, so it's a plausible combination (though even heavier this way), and everything still works in terms of autofocus and such.Overall, definitely a 5-star performer, despite my personal preference for smaller gear."
Bernhard,,Ein Objektiv der Spitzenklasse,"Ich war auf der Suche nach einem Objektiv mit einer großen Offenblende und bin dann nach einiger Recherche auf dieses gestoßen.Nach den ersten Probefotos konnte ich einen kleinen Front-Fokus feststellen.Da ich davon aber schon ausgegangen bin, hab ich damals gleich den USB-Dock mit bestellt.Nach etwas herumprobieren und immer wieder Testfotos schießen und nach-kalibrieren hab ich nun das Optimum aus dem Objektiv herausgeholt.Und das ist echter Wahnsinn! So scharf bei einer Blende 1,8,....UNGLAUBLICH!Klar ist der Schärfebereich bei Objekten in der Nähe relativ bis sehr klein, aber da wo es scharf sein soll ist es das! Und wie!Ich verwende eine Nikon D7200 und kann dieses Objektiv nur weiterempfehlen !An der Verarbeitung lässt sich meiner Meinung nach nichts herum meckern. Solide und gut verarbeitet.Gerne stelle ich Euch von mir gemachte Beispielfotos zur Verfügung!"
TJ,,I really wanted to like it.... but had to send it back (terrible af),"I really wanted to like this lens and I had put off buying it for a long time, with a lot of anxiety about the reported focusing problems. In the end Amazon offered it for a good price and I thought I would give it a go, knowing that I could send it back.I wasted a lot of time attempting to calibrate the lens on a 7d ii (in camera microadjust, sigma dock and even using focal).... and for distances less than 0.5 meters I could get it to focus acceptably. However over 0.5 meters (which most pics are) it is not possible to calibrate due to the total inconsistency in focusing (front and back) on the same target. In short, it is not possible to calibrate for infinity focus. This was particularly obvious in focal, as the standard deviation of the focus accuracy was so huge.If you are shooting video, or intend to manual focus +90% of the time, this lens is a bargain and you should get it.If you want to emulate a full-frame look image (the depth of field is similar to that of a 24-70 2.8 of FF, with a shorter focal range) while shooting reportage/journalistic, or anything that needs af, don't get this lens. I would also say that the af speed is only OK likely no good for servo af with fast moving targets.Finally Sigma were very unhelpful with this issue, finger pointing at canon lenses having the same problem - in my experience this could not be further from the truth."
Florent,,Made me switch from a Canon 80D to Sony a6400,"Got this lens on Amazon for around 600 pounds about 6 months ago.I had recently started photography and owned a Canon 80D camera. I wanted a lens for my APS-C sensor which would give me f/2.8 full-frame equivalent results. I was not disappointed with the results in terms of image quality! I like to shoot portraits (full body to closer) and I shoot wide open most of the time (probably because of lack of talent/practice). So this lens is perfect for that, I can get nice out of focus background and the 18-35 range is great for me.But... the autofocus on my Canon 80D was nothing short of horrible in the viewfinder (phase detect)! AF was perfect in liveview however (as expected). But it made the lens unusable for me because shooting in liveview on a Canon 80D is really slow. I purchased the Sigma USB dock and did probably over 10 hours of attempts of calibration. I sent the Lens to Sigma for them to do their calibration as well. Nothing did it... until I switched to a mirrorless camera.So I decided to switch to a Sony a6400 with the Sigma MC-11 adaptor. The a6400 had just been released and was boasting great focus performance. Adapted lenses don't always do very well, but the a6400 + MC-11 + Sigma 18-35mm give me really good AF. I've set the drive speed to slow and the shutter priority to AF on the camera. And while it's not the fastest, it's fast enough for me and works great with Face/Eye AF.I am now extremely happy with the lens and it's on my Sony a6400 constantly (I don't own a Sony E mount anyway)."
Julian Croot,,"Buttery smooth, sharp, fast, awesome.","I've had this for quite a while now, and for video work it is simply in class of its own. The zoom and focus rings are buttery smooth (much more so than any canon lens I've used), the F1.8 aperture lets in more light than most primes, its built solidly, and is incredibly sharp.Oh, and it comes with nice case and a solid lens hood (neither of which canon include outside their expensive L series).This lens deserves all the praise it almost universally gets in the press. My one caveat would be if you want to use this as a stills lens then the autofocus, although good, is not as reliable as canon lenses... so you just might get some shots that 'miss'.however, for my purposes this lens is amazing."
Mr A,,Perfect - on a Sony body,Had a Canon 7dii and 80d and had back focus issues intermittently. Now on a Sony a6500 via a MC-11 adapter this thing is absolutely amazing! Spot on focusing. One of the best lenses ive ever used in the last 25 years. Super sharp. Super crisp. Totally recommend.
Old Croc,,Rather Disappointing...,"The quality and speed of this lens is first class. It lets in an extraordinary amount of light and has good colour coverage. It's auto-focusing function is fast too.What I didn't expect and am wholly disappointed with, is to recieve a product that does not give a clear, sharp focus out of the box! It's always been a given with purchasing a lens that it will work in that respect. After researching, I'm now having to make an additional purchase of a Sigma USB Dock in order to calibrate the lens just to get a sharp focus!If Sigma lenses need additional hardware to be purchased to ensure that they are fit for purpose out of the box, then the advertiser / Supplier and also the manufacturer, really ought to make that known upfront in the product description."
James Stringer,,Probably the best lens I've ever used,"Believe the hype, this is without a doubt THE best lens I've ever shot with. Images are painfully sharp at any aperture or focal length, and colour rendition and contrast are beautiful. You get wonderful, creamy backgrounds, though admittedly not to the same extent as with a fast portrait lens. It's built like a tank and feels really great to hold and use ; the focus and zoom rings are quite firm but not at all in a bad way. However, it is quite heavy but it balances really well on my camera and I rarely notice the weight.The only real downside I can think of is the quite short zoom range, but I've rarely had it bother me - I bought this to replace a couple of primes so any zoom at all is excellent. I can imagine that pairing this with the Sigma 50-100mm would be a great combo, but I haven't got the money or need for that right now.Long story short if you should a lot in the wide-normal range just do yourself a favour and get this lens, it's a masterpiece of optical engineering."
Martin @PCTechHubUK,,The YouTubers lens,This lens is just epic! I have been wanting one for so long but just haven’t been able to afford it as it doesn’t come cheap. When I got it I was not disappointed.The quality of the image that this lens produces is incredible. Being a relative novice to filming and photography I can not believe what a huge difference good glass makes!It has a really nice depth of field thanks to its huge f1.8 aperture. It’s really made me step up my A and B roll shots.Known as the YouTubers lens and for good reason.If you have the money and you’re a content creator I highly recommend it.
The Hughes Family,,"Great value, get rid of all those prime lenses","Well where to begin, firstly this thing is a beast! Very solidly made with a great focus and zoom feel it really does feel like a high end lens. The shots you can take with this beauty are absolutely stunning, from razor crisp wide angles to artistic soft focus shots at 35mm it really is like everyone says...a whole bag of primes in one lens.The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is the focus can be tricky to master. Many people have said the dock and an afternoon of calibration will improve this but really for the price they should not need that kind of work. However using it mostly in manual as an alternative to multiple prime lenses this thing is cheap as hell and well worth a purchase. Would definitely be saving up to buy more of the sigma art series."
Rudy Visuals,,Fantastic lens for video and great all versatility for photos,"Have used this lens with an 80D for the past couple of weeks and absolutely love it for video. Image quality is top notch but wide open it can be a bit difficult to focus when takes photos but when the shot is in focus it's sharper than anything I've ever used on the 80D. Love the focal range, wide enough for landscapes and at 35mm on a crop sensor you can still get decent enough portraits. It is a little on the heavy side so that's something to bear in mind.If you would like to see video samples search 'Rudy Visuals' on Youtube and look at our latest videos, most of these will have been shot on the Sigma 18-35."
Amazon Customer,,Incredible sharp and useful lens!,"Hi,I bought this lens 5 months ago and is really worth the price. I'm shot mainly landscapes. Lack of OS is not a problem in my opinion because of fast aperture when you shooting handheld(f/4 is enough for handheld landscapes). When you shoot portraits you have nice, blur and bokeh.Also useful in astrophotography.Check my photos.Recommend!"
Piotr Janas,,Probably the sharpest lens for APS-C (crop sensor),"I love how sharp this lens is. Also f/1.8 gives you a very shallow depth of field and helps in lowlight situations. The drawbacks are the weight (so so heavy) and lack of image stabilisation. I guess this is the price for a sharp, moderately priced lens. Also, this lens is supposed to be without weather sealing, but so far worked fine for me despite occasional rain. Autofocus sometimes back-focuses which ruins quite a lot of shots in lowlight situations. Works better in well-lit environments. Despite all those drawbacks I love this lens. Used on Nikon D7100 with newest firmware."
Tcshad,,"Sharp, and very heavy","I love this lens, I've wanted it for a long time after seeing the magical f1.8 (which needs to be multiplied by 1.6, obviously, to accommodate for Canon's crop sensor) at such a great focal length.It's VERY sharp.I have done the latest firmware update via the Sigma Canon USB dock, and the lens is just SO fast to focus, whilst being so sharp and still having nice DoF!Really would recommend this lens to anyone with a crop sensor camera, as I think it's beautiful.Though be warned, it's not a lightweight lens, and it will more than likely make your camera front heavy."
Glyn Harrison,,Amazing lens. So sharp and,"Amazing lens. So sharp and the depth of feild is beautiful. Only minor is; with such a shallow depth of field I've found myself taking multiple shots to try to ensure the right part of the image is in focus. It can be a little slow to find it's subject at times too (shooting on a sony a65). Oh! Also, you may want a neck brace if wearing your camera with this thing on for a while, it is heavy!Overall, love this lens, so much fun to shoot with. My portrait shots are looking better than ever."
ZedBee,,Sigma 18-35mm F1.8 DC HSM Lens good with Viltrox for video.,The Sigma 18-35mm F1.8 DC HSM Lens for Canon - Black is a rightly much recommended lens.We use this Sigma lens in manual mode for video utilising a Viltrox. Simply a beautiful lens.Pictures to follow.
Tudor,,Fantastic lens. Highly reccomend!!,"The 18-35 mm is a fantastic zoom range good for all around photography and also for portraits. I have alwas liked Sigma Art lenses. The picture quality is fantastic and 1.8 makes it a good lens for night photography.The build quality is fantastic...in my opinion much more stylish and futuristic than any Nikon/Canon lens (again, strictly my opinion). All in all you get what you pay for and this is a fantastic lens from so many aspects. It would be hard for me to find a downside."
HerrBolatbayev,,Perfektion für APS-C,"Kein einziges ""natives"" Obejktiv kommt in die Nähe des Sigma 18-35 F1,8 DC HSM Art.Das Objektiv ist einfach Weltklasse. Es sicherlich schwer und groß. Der Brennweitenbereich ist begrenzt, ber die Leistung spricht einfach für sich.Ich hatte es an einer D500 udn weder das 20 1,8 noch 24 1,8 noch das 35 1,8 kamen an die schärfe und Darstellung dieses Obejktives ran. Nun habe ich es an einer GH5, mit Metabones Ultra Adapter. DER WAHNSINN! Ich bin mehr als begeistert."
J.W.WILSON,,This is just AWESOME.

iraknas,,Superb Lense (with one flaw),Very good lense. I use it with my Canon 70D and the thing is simply brilliant. Only negative is you can't use the servo autofocus if recording video with sound because your camera microphone or external microphone will pick up the lense focusing noises which are quite loud. If this lense has an ultrasonic motor it would be perfection. For photography and videography where sound quality isn't an issue it already is perfection - couldn't be happier with this purchase.
Amazon Customer,,I am using it on the Panasonic GH4 with a Metabones Speedbooster for video which allows me to have nice soft backgrounds when op,"This is a really lovely lens. I am using it on the Panasonic GH4 with a Metabones Speedbooster for video which allows me to have nice soft backgrounds when opened up to f1.8. It is incredibly sharp too which is great. The only issue is that it does not have internal stabilisation which means it is best used on a tripod or with some kind of stabilisation/gimbal system. Handheld can be a little juddery :-\ Another option would be the Sigma 17-50 but this has max aperture of 2.8. If it had internal stabilisation, then it would get 5 stars."
Stefan,,"Super Objektiv, keine Autofokusprobleme","Nun bin ich auch glücklicher Besitzer dieses Objektivs. Ich benutze es an der Nikon D5200. Auf der Verpackung des Sigma stand „D5300 kompatibel“. Das bedeutet, es gab in der Vergangenheit Probleme bei der D5300 und das wurde nachgearbeitet in der Firmware. Und ich vermute, dass das auch der Grund ist, warum manche Probleme mit dem Autofokus haben, weil eben die Firmware des Objektiv optimal mit der Kamera zusammenarbeiten sollte. Ich habe keine Probleme mit Front- oder Backfokus. Ich hatte das USB-Dock mitbestellt, aber ein Kalibrieren war nicht nötig. Die neuste Firmware-Version 1.01 wurde angezeigt. Ein Firmwareupdate war also nicht nötig. Auch mit dem „Traumflieger Fokus Detektor“ habe ich es überprüft. Absolut knackscharf. Der Fokuspunkt sitzt genau auf 0.Die Verarbeitung in Metallgehäuseausführung ist wirklich ein Traum. Was für ein Unterschied zu den Nikon-Objektiven mit Kunststoffgehäusen. Auch die Fokus- und Zoomringe laufen sowas von butterweich ohne jegliches Spiel. Beim Nikon 18-200 mm z.B. habe ich ein deutliches Spiel beim Fokusring.Die Bildqualität haut einen wirklich vom Hocker. Ich habe weiter die Objektive Nikon 18-200, f3.5-5.6 und Nikon 50mm, f1.8. Das Nikon 18-200 hat auch bereits eine sehr schöne Bildqualität bei diesem riesen Zoombereich. Da kann man echt nicht meckern. Aber das Sigma zeigt jetzt doch einen deutlichen Unterschied an Qualitätszuwachs. Hätte ich nicht gedacht, dass es so enorm ist.Ich habe es in allen möglichen Autofokussituationen getestet, von Makroaufnahmen von Blumen angefangen, in unterschiedlichsten Lichtverhältnissen und kann mir nicht erklären, wie es zu den vielen Diskussionen und Problemen zu diesem Thema kommt. Ich kann mir eigentlich nicht vorstellen, dass es da wirklich so viele Fehlproduktionen des Objektivs geben soll. Ich vermute eher, dass die Eigenarten des Autofokus in unterschiedlichen Lichtsituationen und Fokuspunkten nicht genug berücksichtigt wird. Auch bei 18 mm und Offenblende genau zu fokussieren muss geübt sein. Das Anvisieren muss genau sein, damit die Kamera nicht auf den Hintergrund scharf stellt. Das sind alles Dinge, die man bei jedem Objektiv erleben kann.Also ich kann hier nur das bestätigen, was Gunther Wegner zu diesem Objektiv schon alles geschrieben hat. Auch er hat ja, wenn ich mich richtig besinne, keine Kalibrierung mit dem USB-Dock gemacht. Er hatte nur die neueste Firmware aufgespielt und gut war.Fazit: Es macht einfach nur Spaß, mit diesem Objektiv zu fotografieren. Einen Bildstabilisator beim Fotografieren vermisse ich nicht. Klappt sehr gut ohne. Zum Filmen benutze ich sowieso ein Stativ.Nachtrag: Ich habe nun meine 3 Objektive, das Sigma 18-35, f1.8, das Nikon 18-200, f3.5-5.6 und das Nikon 50 mm, f1.8 bezüglich des Autofokus noch einmal ausführlich mit dem Traumflieger Fokus Detektor (siehe: http://www.traumflieger.de/desktop/fokusdetektor/fokusdetektor.php ) getestet. Meine Nikon-Objektive haben einen ganz leichten Backfokus, der aber noch im „grünen“ Bereich liegt. Das Sigma fokussiert präzise immer genau auf der 0-Linie! Besser kann es nicht mehr sein.Der Fokus-Detektor hat am Rand eine dünne Kreisbogenlinie. Diese besteht aus winzigen Pünktchen. Beim Sigma werden diese Pünktchen wesentlich klarer dargestellt, als bei den Nikon-Objektiven, eben auch klarer als beim Nikon 50 mm, f1.8, was zeigt, dass das Sigma wirklich eine deutlich sichtbar höhere Auflösung hat.Beim Fotografieren gegen die Sonne fiel mir allerdings ein deutlicher Lens-Flare auf. Diesen empfand ich stärker, als ich ihn von meinen Nikon–Objektiven gewohnt war. Diesen möchte ich aber erst noch einmal im Vergleich mit meinem Nikon 18-200 unter möglichst gleichen Bedingungen genau vergleichen, ob er wirklich stärker ist. Mit einem Trick kann man diesen allerdings verschwinden lassen, indem man mit dem Stativ 2 Aufnahmen macht und bei der 2. Aufnahme die Sonne mit einem Finger etwas abdeckt im Bild, bis der Flare verschwindet und dann nachher in Photoshop (z.B.) diese beiden Bilder zusammensetzt.Nachtrag Thema Lens Flares:Nun habe ich gerade einen Test zwischen dem Sigma 18-35, f1.8 und dem Nikon 18-200, f3.5-5.6 im Verhalten beim Fotografieren gegen die Sonne bei Brennweite 18 mm, Blende 10 gemacht. Wie von Sigma beschrieben, werden tatsächlich durch die besondere Vergütungstechnologie Reflexionen weggenommen, so dass das Bild super klar wird. Und das hat eben das Nikon-Objektiv nicht, wodurch große Bildbereiche flau aussehen durch die Reflexionen. Deutliche runde Lens-Flaires tauchen beim Sigma stärker auf als beim Nikon, aber das ist einfach ein physikalischer Umstand, der nicht zu verhindern ist und nicht als Negativpunkt für das Objektiv gesehen werden darf, sondern im Gegenteil: Einfach durch die fehlende Spezialvergütung beim Nikon werden logischerweise dann auch Lensflares weniger sichtbar. So sind dadurch auch der Sonnenstern mit den ausgehenden Sonnenstrahlen beim Abblenden wesentlich schöner beim Sigma als beim Nikon. Und wie gesagt, wie bereits zuvor beschrieben, kann man größere Lensflares einfach mit einem Trick unsichtbar machen. Kleine evtl. mit der Bereichsreparatur in Lightroom.Also auch hier zeigt sich das Sigma wieder klar überlegen und nun sind auch gegen die Sonne fotografiert schöne kontrastreiche Fotos möglich.Ausführliche Fototour mit dem Objektiv gemacht:Nun bin ich von einer intensiven Fototour durch Lima, Cusco und Umgebung, Machu Picchu, Copacabana (Isla de La luna und Isla del sol) und La Paz zurück und konnte das Sigma 18-35 weiter ausgiebig testen. Allein Cusco ist ja etwas ganz besonderes und bietet unglaubliche Fotomotive. Ich muss sagen, ohne das Sigma wären so manche Fotos nicht möglich geworden. Den Köcher des Sigma hatte ich am Gürtel angeschnallt für mein Nikon 18-200 benutzt und konnte so in 10 Sekunden einen Objektivwechsel machen. Aber für die meisten Aufnahmen braucht man wirklich nur das Sigma. Allerdings, das Sigma passt mit aufgesetzter Gegenlichtblende nicht in den Köcher (deswegen benutze ich umgehängte Fototasche für schnelles ablegen des Sigma darin). Man sollte aber die Gegenlichtblenden tunlichst IMMER auf dem Objektiv richtig herum lassen, weil sie einfach auch ein wichtiger Schutz für das Objektiv ist. Den Unsinn mit den UV-Filtern als Schutz sollte man ja nicht machen, sonst verliert man an Bildqualität.Weiterhin konnte ich mich über den präzisen Autofokus am Sigma erfreuen und zwar bei allen Fokuspunkten, auch bei den äußeren (habe Nikon D5200).Jeder, der meine Fotos sieht, ist erstaunt über die brillante hohe Auflösung und Klarheit der Bilder. Die hohe Auflösung (und natürlich die hohe Lichtstärke) kommt einem auch bei sehr schlechten Lichtverhältnissen zugute, die ich öfter hatte (z.B. in der historischen Markthalle St. Pedro in Cusco).Das Gewicht hat mich bei meinen Fototouren nicht gestört (fast 1,7 kg mit Kamera). Als Abschluss machte ich ein paar Zeitrafferaufnahmen von La Paz bei Nacht mit dem Objektiv und war auch hier wieder begeistert von der Bildqualität."
Bex,,Weddings,"My favourite lens especially to use at weddings. I use it with a Canon 7d, so it makes up for the cropper frame. Really good in low light. It weighs about heavier than a camera body."
Ed,,Great lens for film look DSLR/Mirrorless Shooting.,This lens is an absolute beast for cinematic DSLR video work.

Inazuma,,Gute und interessante lichtstarke Optik,"Gute und interessante lichtstarke Optik mit etwas Schwächen.Die Bildqualität ist top. Kaum Verzeichnung, scharf und kontrastreich.Der AF ist aber leider nicht der schnellste. Ich habe die Canonvariante. An der 7D recht genau. Aber nicht all zu flott. An der Sony A6500 mit dem MC-11-Adapter kämpft es dann richtig. Aber wenn der AF dann sitzt richtig scharf und auf den Punkt. Aber für sportlichere Aufnahmen nicht geeignet.Dafür besteht an der A6500 die Möglichkeit aufs Auge scharf stellen zu lassen. Und das fast übers gesamte Bild. Also kann man sich auf den Bildausschnitt konzentrieren. Und nicht erst scharfstellen und dann verschwenken. Was natürlich einigex an Fokusfehlern ausschliesst. Man hat weit weniger Ausschuss.Also im großen und ganzen eine Toplinse.Schwächen sind das recht hohe Gewicht (was der hohen Lichtstärke geschultet ist) und der etwas träge Autofokus."

Y la verdad es que estoy muy contento con el, el material se nota de buena calidad y demetal. El único pero, y ya sabía de eso, es que pesa mucho, bastante. Por eso no lo uso como un objetivo para llevar a diario. Lo uso más para mi estudio ya que es muy versátil. La tercera estrella se la doy al sabor, no se porque me preguntan sobre el sabor. Pero ya que me lo pregunta, le pase la lengua al objetivo y sabe bien. Entre goma y metal. Pero no encontré nada raro."

Mr. DR Dobson,,Five Stars,"Brilliant, just as all the reviews said about this lens."
Nikolaus,,Das beste Standard Objektiv für APS-C,"Ich fotografiere mit einer Spiegelreflexkamera - Canon EOS 200D - also einer etwas besseren Einsteigerkamera. Ich benutzte bis vor kurzem diverse STM-Objektive von Canon, die ich prinzipiell auch alle positiv bewerten kann. Jedes einzelne davon macht seine Sache gut, so z.B. das 40mm Pancake f2,8 sowie das 50mm f1,8 für Portraits. Das Standardobjektiv bisher war das 18-135mm IS STM Objektiv von Canon. Ein rundum gutes Objektiv mit einem sehr vielseitigen Einsatzbereich. Damit filme ich auch gerne, was wegen des STM-Motors und des sehr guten Bildstabilisators auch wunderbar funktioniert.Für den Portraitbereich habe ich nun im Brennweitenbereich um 24mm bis 35mm etwas geeignetes gesucht und bin auf dieses Objektiv von Sigma gestoßen (40mm f2,8 und 50mm f1,8 habe ich ja bereits, ist mir aber gerade in Innenräumen an APS-C oft etwas zu lang). Der Preis des Sigma hat mich etwas abgeschreckt sowie auch die Tatsache, dass dieses Objektiv mit dem Sigma-Adapter in vielen Fällen erst an die Kamera angepasst werden muss. So etwas musste ich bisher noch nie machen.Ich habe dennoch den Schritt gewagt - und bin jetzt restlos begeistert. Das Objektiv bildet so absolut scharf ab - es ist der Wahnsinn. Das Spiel mit Schärfe und Unschärfe lässt jedes Fotografenherz höher schlagen, zudem das Bokeh traumhaft ist. Ich kann wirklich sagen, mit diesem Objektiv bin ich in eine andere Liga befördert worden. Die Portraits haben vollformatigen Look, ich kann in dunklen Räumen mit niedrigen ISO-Werten aus der Hand fotografieren wo bisher mit den Standard-Objektiven die Bilder nur noch hoffnungslos verrauscht gewesen wären.Hut ab vor Sigma. Da ich gerne im Portraitbereich fotografiere möchte ich mir das Sigma 50-100mm ebenfalls zulegen. Sigma hat mich so was von überzeugt.Ja, das Objektiv ist schwer, aber es fühlt sich absolut wertig an und mittlerweile ist es mein Immerdrauf-Objektiv. Ich musste es tatsächlich mit dem Sigma-Adapter justieren, aber entgegen meinen Befürchtungen war die Sache relativ easy - selbst ich hab es geschafft. Also nur Mut.Die beiden ersten Bilder sind mit f1,8 in einer dunklen gotischen Kirche entstanden - freihand. An den beiden Beerenbildern ist das Bokeh erkennbar. Und das letzte Bild entstand auf dem Stativ bei Nacht als Langzeitbelichtung wobei besonders die Bildschärfe und auch die Schönheit der Lichtsterne sichtbar wird.Fazit: meine absolute Kaufempfehlung für jeden APS-C Fotografen!"
Fyfey96,,Amazing bit of Kit,Amazing Lens. I need say no more.
Lorenz,,Highly recommended.,Sharp picture quality corner to corner. Very nice depth of field. It is a heavy lens. But the pros definitely outweigh the cons. Highly recommended.
Cliente de Amazon,,lente todo en uno,"* probado en sensor aps-c * Este lente es increiblemente bueno y versatil. Lo recomiendo al 100%. Para el día a día (y hasta la noche) no necesitas salir con otro.pros:- Cubre desde un amplio rango en 18mm hasta un enfoque semi-cercano de 35mm. Ideal para fotos de sitios, , paisajes, personas, mascotas, etc. La mayoría de los casos los cubres con este lente.- Es super bueno con los detalles y el bokeh a una distancia semi-corta (30cm-2mts), luego de 2mts, el bokeh se va perdiendo, pero el F1.8 igual ayuda mucho para la luz.- el F1.8 es excelente para fotos de noche y/o en malas condiciones de luz, si tienes una camara relativamente vieja con un ISO bajo, este lente le puede dar una nueva vida, reduciendo el ruido generado por la compensación del ISO.- el F1.8 con 18-35mm también es ideal para fotos de objetos en constante movimiento cercanos a tí, es especialmente útil para mascotas y niños.- Super recomendado para videos. queda super nítido y con mucho detalle.- El lente es de metal super-sólido. Viene con su propio estuche.- El motor de autofocus es extremadamente silencioso, y rápido, se compara con un ultrasonic de canon. Enfoca muy bien en baja luz.Contras:- No es nada liviano, tiene una construcción de metal, si lo comparas con el 18-55mm de plástico que viene por defecto en una camara canon, vas a descubrir que pesa muchisimo mas (casi 4 veces mas). Una Rebel txi normal con este lente, va a terminar pesando como 1.6-1.8kg.- 18-35mm no es telefoto. No esperes hacer fotos de objetos a la distancia con gran detalle.- El lente es super grande físicamente. no es algo para guardar en el bolsillo, además en formato 4:3 con un flash integrado, por lo grande del lente, puede dejar una sombra pequeña abajo de la foto. Esto se soluciona poniendo una resolución 16:9 (recortando un poquito abajo de la foto), o usando un flash externo.- No tiene estabilización de imagen (tomar en cuenta especialmente en un video donde el camarógrafo le tiemble la mano), sin embargo, esto último se compensa con el peso del lente.Para mi, ninguno de estos contras opaca la versatilidad y la excelencia de este lente. 100% recomendado"

Kindle-Kunde,,Funktioniert an Canon nachweislich nicht,"Einzigartiges objektiv, jedoch hatte ich an 3 Exemplaren (getestet an 650d, 2×77d, 600d) IMMER einen deutlichen fehlfokus von 5mm - 8mm.Mir fiel das ganze in der Praxis durch deutlich verwaschene Bilder auf. Der Fokus Test setzte sich dann aus dem Traumflieger Testchart sowie live Tests mit normalen Objekten zusammen.Der Hersteller hat nach zwei Reparaturversuchen das Geld zurück erstattet. Warum beim ersten mal das defekte objektiv ohne Veränderung zurück geschickt wurde, weiß ich nicht - womöglich haben die 160 Aufnahmen mit fehlfokus ein Umdenken bewirkt.Aus Neugierde habe ich dann im Laden mehrfach Gläser auf ebenfalls vorrätigen Kameras getestet. Immer mit dem selben Ergebnis - unübersehbarer Fehlfokus.Wieso das niemandem auffällt, verstehe ich nicht."

luca,,ottima scelta,"ho diversi obiettivi di diverse marche. la ricerca di soluzioni a volte pratiche a volte di qualità mi ha sempre spinto nella direzione dei tuttofare per la praticità e delle lenti fisse per la qualità. Ho acquistato il 18-35 alla ricerca della qualità su diverse focali e devo dire cho ho davvero fatto centro. LA risoluzione è strepitosa, quasi imbarazzante. La luminosità stupisce. Forse potrebbe essere un filino pesante per alcuni ma francamente, con questa lente montata sulla mia d7200, ho camminato per 18Km in montagna fino ad arrivare a 2600 metri e non ho avuto particolari problemi. Comunque, dopo varie sessioni devo dire che la soddisfazione è davvero alta. L'assenza dello stabilizzatore non si fa sentire. in situazioni di scarsa luminosità si apprezza la grande apertura della lente. A diaframmi più chiusi la nitidezza è fantastica, diventa una lama, quasi ai livelli dell'afs nikkor 40 micro (che di risoluzione ne ha da vendere). il prezzo è la scarsa escursione che, a volte, costringe al cambio lente, ma va bene così: vale la pena soffrire un po' per poi beneficiare di scatti fantastici"

sophie,,Back front focus,"après avoir reçu l'objectif, je fais directement un test vite fait au vu des commentaires parlant du problème back front focus … et effectivement toutes mes photos son floue …J'avais anticipé en achetant le dock sigma et regarder des tuto .Donc je commence directement les réglages comme il se doit, cible + bien à 45 degrés + tout de niveau et sur trépied , respect des distance et avec télécommande 100 ISO et à f/1.8tout semble fonctionner correctement avec les réglages de + 12 etc. … cela me prend déjà +/- 4 heure avec beaucoup de photos faites .Après avoir tout fait je teste dans la maison et les 3 photos sur 4 ont de nouveau le même problème .Je refais des tests sur le trépied avec la cible et je m'aperçois que sur 4 fois la même photo sans bouger , juste en bougeant la bague de mise au point pour qu'il fasse le travail de lui même, il ne fait jamais la même mise au point … bref je renvoie l'objectif et commande un autre et là toujours la même chose, renvoyé également ainsi que le dock sigma .j'ai passé +/- 8 h à faire des réglages pour aucun résultat .pour moi c'est fini Sigma et de même avec Tamron ou j'ai également eu le même problème avec les 24/70 g2...Les photos on été prisent après réglage, avant c'était encore plus fort ...sur la photo avec l'ange la mise en points et faite sur la tête et c'est le pied qui est net.Les photo avec la fleur c'est sur celle du haut a droit que la mise au point est fait et c'est la fleur en bas qui est net … bref les photos parlées d'elle-même ..."
Dennis,,Super - Sehr zufrieden,"Ich suchte schon sehr lange nach einem Weitwinkel, dass meinen Objektivsatz komplettieren würde. Monate lang habe ich vergleichen und überlegt. Letztenendes habe ich mich für das Sigma entschieden. Ist mein erstes von diesem Hersteller. Ich habe den Kauf nicht bereut. Es ist extrem wertig verarbeitet. Zoom-und Fokusring lassen sich sehr gut erreichen und haben einen angenehmen widerstand. Natürlich das wichtigste, die Bildqualität. Gut- ich bin kein Profi, aber die Qualität bei Fotos ist schon extrem gut. Bisher habe ich noch keine Funktionseinschränkungen feststellen können."

MR Richard BELCHER,,Very happy,Nice fast lens with excellent photo quality.
robby-d,,Phenomenal image quality,"I don't need to re-state what others have already said. This lens is heavy, big, only a 2x zoom, and produces absolutely phenomenal images. I mount it to my A6500 all the time (with the MC-11 adapter), and it never disappoints.Highly recommended.UPDATE 2018-04-12: After 1 year this lens continues to impress. Sharp as a tack, despite its weight it is often my go-to lens when I'm using my a6500. It has an interesting colour profile, tending to over-represent yellow-greens especially in back-lit conditions, and doesn't have the ghosting and flare control of the truly expensive lenses. However, it takes truly lovely pictures, and I continue to highly recommend this lens.A brief note on Sony cameras, AF, and these lenses: They do NOT require calibration if used on a mirrorless system, because of the way autofocus works - it's directly on the sensor, so the lens will focus perfectly every time. (there are exceptions but they are rare). With the Sigma MC-11 adapter this focuses just as well as many of my native lenses."
Jesús Angel Gutiérrez Carabias,,Una gran DECEPCION... al menos en Micro Cuatro Tercios con adaptador Viltrox,"Tras leer y ver multitud de comentarios y reviews sobre este lente, pensé que era el perfecto para mi Panasonic G9, (similiar a GH5, GH4, etc, solo que mejor en autofoco y en IBIS pero con menos opciones de video), y viendo que casi todos mis lentes, son de focal fija, decidí lanzarme a por un Zoom con un 1.8 constante, que para video era un requisito fundamental para mi.Hice un video y lo he puesto en Youtube, para que se vea y escuche el desastre que supone este lente, con este combo (Viltrox) en la Panasonic, porque resulta que nada más ponerlo, empiezo a escuchar un ruido, que a simple vista es perceptible, pero que cuando ves el material grabado resulta que es como si tuvieras un Tractor en lugar de un Lente. Horrible. Resulta que viendo más reviews en internet ya lo comentaban, pero desde luego no le daban la magnitud que es en realidad. Por tanto os resumo mi decepción.1. Ruido horrible, especialmente si grabas con Micro externo (tipo esos pequeños de Rode), porque la punta del micro apunta directamente al origen del ruido, y es que justo delante tiene la bocacha del lente, por donde sale toda la ruidera. Con el micro interno se oye menos, pero claro ahí entonces al renunciar al externo se empiezan a escuchar más otras cosas, como la manipulación de la cámara, tu respiración, etc, y aún así sigue escuchándose al ""Tractor"" que llevas delante, es decir al Sigma. Y es que cuando digo que se oye, no me refiero a un leve chasquido, es impresionante, es un ruido que te anula el material, horroroso.2. El autofoco (al menos con este combo Sigma+Viltrox) es NEFASTO, tanto en foto como en video. En foto sufre de un Backfocus atroz, y olvidate de eso de dejar el dedito en el pulsador hasta mitad para que enfoque, porque enfoca mal, e incluso cuando ""parece"" que has enfocado bien luego lo ves en el ordenador y sigue el backfocus ahí. En el caso de las fotos se soluciona con un Dock (que también compré) porque no hay forma de actualizar el lente sin dejarte 60 pavos en el Dock, y de paso sirve para tratar de corregir el problemón de Backfocus que ya en Sigma saben que sufre el lente. Y aún sabiéndolo, en lugar de corregirlo, fabrican un Dock para que te lo soluciones tú (previo pago de otros 60€ claro), todo con la excusa del firmware. Una vergüenza, porque encima es un proceso muy tedioso de ""acierto-error- que lleva varias horas y mucha paciencia a base de hacer fotos, descargarlas, poner el dock y corregir, eso en cada paso de focal, horrible.3. El enfoque manual. Pues viendo todo lo anterior, y sobre todo porque la verdad que el lente tiene una nitidez y unas prestaciones muy buenas, pues uno puede optar por olvidarse de todo lo anterior, no usar el autofoco, grabar el sonido a parte (o no grabarlo), y enfocar manualmente, porque no queda otra opción. Pues no, tampoco. Porque resulta que el anillo del lente de entrada tiene un cierto juego, no gira fino y preciso como se espera, encima debido a esa resistencia se resiente el conjunto Sigma-Viltrox-Cámara, pues en cada uno de los engarces de esos tres elementos hay un cierto juego, así que combinado con el dichoso juego del anillo de enfoque, el resultado es un Triple juego a la vez que además del ruido que produce, hace que en plena operación de enfoque manual a 1.2 o a lo que sea, pues se mueva la cámara con todos los micro golpes que se generan por la falta de ajuste. Horroroso, con lo cual también problema con el enfoque manual.4. El tema del peso. Una pasada, ya que los usuarios de Micro 4/3 le tenemos que añadir a ese de por sí pesado lente, un metabones o un viltrox. Es demasiado peso, a los 5 minutos estás deseando soltar el bicho.En definitiva, una pena. Puede que en cámaras APSC vaya de cine este lente, no lo pongo en duda, tal vez en una Sony que ya de por sí tienen un enfoque extraordinario, u en otras que no necesiten adaptadores Metabones/Viltrox, etc.. Pero lo que es seguro es que en Panasonic/Olympus , es decir en Micro 4/3 es una mal combo, y es una pena de verdad porque el lente es una maravilla en cuanto a nitidez y calidad.Por último, os pongo unos datos que yo andaba buscando y que una vez lo tuve pude comprobar.Es un lente este 18-35 f1.8 que en Micro 4/3 con Viltrox x0,71 se convierte en un 12,78 (casi 13mm) - 24,85 (casi 25mm), con lo cual ""redondeando"" pasarías a tener un 13-25 mm a f1.2 constante (con Viltrox es la velocidad a la que llega, y que incluso te indica esa f/ en el monitor. Es una pasada, y aún estando abierto a 1.2 ofrece una nitidez excelente. El punto perfecto lo coge a f2Debes tener en cuenta que cuando está abierto del todo (a 13mm) según el lado al que gires la cámara se nota una sombra en el lado, especialmente en las esquinas. Es como si el límite del lente entrara ligeramente en plano. Lo cual se solventa cerrando el encuadre, pero que lo sepas.El autofoco, cuando busca el enfoque, tiene por costumbre irse al final (al infinito) a toda leche y volver (también a toda leche) con lo cual en la ida se pasa de largo el objeto a enfocar, y en la vuelta se pasa también ligeramente de largo, y normalmente en el siguiente viaje ya atina, pero a veces son 3-4 pasaditas las que pega al objeto a enfocar, ida larga, vuelta media, ida cortita y en la última vuelta cortita engarza ya. El efecto es horroroso, máxime cuando mi 14mm pancake de Lumix a f/2.5 lo hace suave y normalmente (casi siempre) ajusta en el 1er viaje, no suele necesitar los 4 o 5 del Sigma, y si los necesita alguna vez es algo muy raro, en el caso del Sigma lo raro es que se pegue solo 1 viaje hasta dar con el foco.Todas estas cosillas, son las que casi nadie te cuenta, no sé si porque no le dan importancia, que la tiene, o porque les da igual. Pero a mi tanto el tener que renunciar al sonido con micro externo, como al autofoco, como a la precisión del enfoque manual, pues es algo que no se advierte al comprar el producto. Si me dices el peso excesivo, pues vale porque ya te lo dicen, o que tienes que comprarte un Dock de 60 pavos para actualizar el lente, pues vale porque tambíen lo dicen, (lo que no avisan es que vas a tener que dejarte la paciencia ajustando el foco para corregir el Back y Front Focus con el que viene).Personalmente me habría gustado saber estas cosas, y sobre todo que no se fabrique una cosa con prestaciones a las que tienes que renunciar, para eso que no pongan autofoco, ni nada de eso, pero si lo ponen que menos que funcione dignamente.El lente está devuelto, y no dudo que Sigma sea una gran marca, solo que las adaptaciones y los combos estos para poder usar un lente diseñado para otro tipo de cuerpos, a veces conllevan más contraindicaciones que beneficios. Los contras son demasiados, y en Micro 4/3 la verdad que tenemos un abanico de lentes fantásticas que visto lo visto con los combos, mejor lo nativo."
Cliente de Amazon,,Arte en tus manos,"Como fotografo aficionado tengo lentes marca nikon el 35mm en DX y un FX de 50 mm el cual claramente se notan la diferencia cuando haces una toma, la nitidez , los colores , todo emerge de una manera fantástica a diferencia de lentes de rokinon y samyang.Cuando veo los retratos de 50mm FX 1.8 de nikon me dejaban sin respiración.Cuando probé este lente Sigma a 1.8 - y 35mm fue algo maravilloso, ver los retratos que puedes conseguir, es una belleza ver los detalles de los rostros , la nitidez con la que captura este lente es increíble el resultado, es un lente hecho con la mayor calidad.Se nota en el cuerpo del objetivo, los materiales de primera y es bello a la vista. Tengo una cámara nikon d5500 y me quedé sin respiración con los retratos , no me imagino lo que podrá lograr con una NIKON D500 o una 7500 aprovechando la gran capacidad de gestión del ISO.En cuanto a paisajes he realizado tanto en el dia con resultados muy agradables a 18mm y en la noche puedes ver los puntos de luz excelentemente definidos en tomas aéreas.Es un lente que me tomó mucho tiempo poder decidirme si comprarlo o no. Investigue mucho en muchas paginas y ahora estoy contento con el resultado pero se que estudiándolo mas podre sacarle mas provecho creo que con 1 mes de uso estoy en la superficie de las capacidades de este lente.Mi consejo es que si tu cámara no tiene ajuste de enfoque ""Fine Focus"", debes comprar el DOCK para calibrar este lente, a mi me tomo unas horas en calibrarlo, es un trabajo repetitivo y tedioso pero necesario. una vez teniendo los parámetros correctos el lente se comporta excelente.El autofocus es bueno pero con mi camara D5500 podría ir mucho mejor. Me imagino que con un sistema de autofocus avanzado como en D7200, D7500, D500 se comportaría excelente."
marco t.,,La luminosità e la nitidezza fatti ad obiettivo,"Ho una canon 80D, da tempo tenevo d'occhio sia il sigma in oggetto sia il Canon 17-55; alla fine sono riuscito a prendere il sigma ad un prezzo ragionevole. Avevo qualche timore viste le recensioni che lamentavano problemi di front back focus proprio sulla 80D, ma devo dire che non sto riscontrando problemi nelle foto. Nei video o nel live view sapevo già che non avrei avuto problemi in quanto il DPAF di canon va molto bene col sigma. Peso sicuramente importante, ma risultati pazzeschi. Mi riservo di inserire la quinta stella più avanti in quanto penso che ci voglia più tempo per poter essere sicuri del massimo punteggio. Ah dimentica, io ho tenuto come lente tuttofare meno impegnativo, il 15-85 USM Stabilizzato: un obbiettivo ottimo e ben fatto... il sigma non ha nulla d invidiare come manifattura, eccelle anche in quello e le ghiere sono fluide e precise. Consiglio sicuramente l'acquisto.Aggiornamento 29/05/2020Do le 5 stelle perché è un obbiettivo fenomenale; nessun problema di fuoco con la mia 80d, preciso, nitido, luminosità al top."
hc900,,Semplicemente unico nel suo genere,"Un zoom speciale da ogni punto di vista, davvero eccellente come resa cromatica, ma anche meccanicamente ineccepibile con fuoco e zoom interni, utile funzione Full Time Manual Focus sulla ghiera di fuoco, davvero molto robusto.Pesa parecchio, ingombra e ha poca estensione di focali: era meglio 16-30mm o anche meno.Ma non esiste concorrenza per questo favoloso Sigma 18-35mm Art luminoso ben f/1,8.Un record imbattuto e una qualità fotografica senza riserve.Ottima la garanzia ufficiale di ben 3 anni."
AL,,Bel objectif mais...,"Bel objectif, finition magnifique.J'ai retourné cet objectif, son autofocus étant beaucoup trop aléatoire.A 18mm sur f/1.8, j'avais soit du front focus, soit du back focus.Il n'y a qu'à 24mm à f/4 que cela semblait correct, et effectivement quand il accroche, le résultat est incroyable.Aux petites ouvertures, vraiment trop aléatoire sur mon 70D.Vu le prix, en aucun cas je n'ai envie d'investir dans un dock usb et m'amuser des heures à plier + coller une mire et faire les tests + calibrage.Je préfère prendre un EF-S 17-55 f/2.8, et perdre de la luminosité, mais m'assurer d'un autofocus qui accroche et avec une stabilisation.Si Sigma décide un jour d'assurer un calibrage correct pour les modèles courants, alors oui c'est le meilleur de sa catégorie en APS-C."
marco,,Objetivo Polivalente,"Llevo ya unos meses acompañado de este objetivo.Tengo también el 50 mm. 1.4 de Sigma pero prácticamente no lo suelo montar, al tener una APSC (Canon 77D) los 50mm. se convierten en 80 mm. y prefiero la polivalencia de un objetivo zoom. Nada que envidiar a la gama L de Canon, a relación calidad-precio, no hay color. El objetivo viene con bolsa y parasol. En el mismo pedido adquirí el dock para actualizar el firmware, 100% recomendable. Vino todo correctamente, sin golpes, y en la fecha informada. Tenía un poco de miedo inicial al comprar algo tan caro por Amazon pero el precio que te ahorras de una tienda física me hizo comprarlo aquí. Buena decisión.Ciertamente es el objetivo que suelo usar casi siempre. Es pesado, eso que no tiene estabilizador. La apertura del diafragma en un zoom es lo que suele lastrar a estos objetivos pero aquí es su punto fuerte. Quizás el punto dulce hasta f2.8 no lo consigue y carece un poco de nitidez si está en f1.8 (sobretodo comparado con el 50mm., no hay color) pero bajando la apertura y siempre más cerca o superando el punto dulce las fotografías son supernítidas. Es un gran objetivo para APSC, para todo tipo de fotografías, destacando en paisaje y urbana.Las únicas pegas que tengo sobre él es esa sensación de poca nitidez cuando el diafragma está abierto del todo, comparándolo con una focal fija, sumándole un poco de desenfoque también. A partir de su punto dulce las fotografías son supernítidas. Además el autofocus aveces se vuelve un poco loco. Por lo demás, estoy encantado, tenía la idea de una fija de 35 mm. también de Sigma pero con este no hace falta, dándote la polivalencia de ser un objetivo zoom."

AlfredoPL,,Its a very good lens but is not perfect.,"I like this lens but I dont know if I was expecting too much or what. I know that it might be one of the best lenses for APS-C cameras but just makes me a bit sad that this is the best so far. Im using it with a nikon D7200 and sometimes I have problems focusing (And is not the camera, I double checked). Sometimes I miss the OS and the 50mm focal length in the sigma 17-50 although it was f/2.8. Overall its a good lens, VERY VERY sharp but Im not a 100% sure if I would buy it again."
RNX85,,"Strepitoso, accoppiata killer con gh4","Il Sigma 18-35mm F1.8 DC HSM Art per reflex APS-C è il primo obiettivo al mondo ad avere una apertura costante di F1.8, sarà disponibile per le fotocamere Sigma, Nikon, Canon, Pentax e Sony. Offre la profondità di campo di una lente dello stesso modello, a diaframma costante a F2.7 su full-frame.Possiede un motore AF silenzioso (Hyper Sonic Motor) e l'ottica è costituita da 17 elementi, suddivisi in 12 gruppi, con 5 elementi in vetro SLD e 4 elementi asferici.Unico contro è la mancanza di tropicalizzazioneSigma si è trovata una nicchia davvero interessante con questo 18-35 f/1,8 e la soddisfa non solo nei numeri ma anche nei fatti, con un obiettivo di elevata qualità sotto ogni punto di vista: costruzione, fuoco, ghiere, ottica.Il peso e la lunghezza possono renderlo troppo importante per dei corpi APS-C entry-level, ma non sono certamente quelli i suoi compagni idealiSi fatica davvero a trovare qualche elemento da inserire nella colonna dei contro, qualcuno dice che manca la stabilizzazione ma per le focali in gioco e con questa apertura sarebbe stata sostanzialmente un di più, un inutile aggiuntiva su costi, dimensione e peso."
Peter C.,,"Super Objektiv, leider ohne Kalibrierung mittels USB-Dock unbrauchbar","Nach dem 70-200 2.8 Sport ist dieses mein zweites Sigma-Objektiv. Von dem 70-200 war ich schon überzeugt und habe deswegen mir jetzt auch das 18-35 zugelegt.Vorweg das Negative: Im Auslieferungszustand habe ich bei Tag draußen 329 Aufnahmen gemacht. Davon waren fast alle Aufnahmen unbrauchbar. Ich konnte lediglich 5 Aufnahmen verwenden.Der Fokus hat absolut nicht gepasst. Es war ein massiver Frontfokus zu sehen, und das bei allen Brennweiten.Da ich schon mit dem 70-200 das USB-Dock bestellt hatte, habe ich das 18-35 angeschlossen und den Fokus über alle Blenden und alle Brennweiten mit +11 korrigiert. Dabei wäre +20 das maximale, was geht.Jetzt sitzt der Fokus und das Objektiv tut seinen Dienst. Ohne das USB-Dock hätte ich das Objektiv zurück geschickt. Sowas habe ich noch bei keinem Objektiv erlebt.Eine weitere Session mit einer ähnlichen Anzahl von Bildern hat nun ein ganz anderes Ergebnis geliefert. Die meisten Bilder sind knackscharf. Einige der jetzt noch unscharfen Bilder nehme ich auf meine Kappe, da ich vermutlich Fehler gemacht habe, oder aber nicht genau genug Fokussiert habe. Bei Blende 1.8 ist der Fokusbereich halt ganz schön eng. Da muss man schon sorgfältig sein und es kann halt schnell mal was ""daneben gehen"", zumal ich meist bei bewegten Objekten daneben lag.Die Qualität der Bilder sucht für mich seinesgleichen. Das hat schon die Qualität mancher Festbrennweite. Ich kann qualitativ keinen Unterschied zu meiner Festbrennweite 50mm F1.8 von Canon feststellen.Letztendlich habe ich nun eine neue Lieblingslinse für den Verwendungszweck für den es sich eignet. Bei mir sind das bislang Landschaftsaufnahmen, meinen Hund in naher Umgebung und indoor Personen ablichten.Ich habe lange überlegt, ob der fehlende Bildstabilisator ein Problem für mich sein würde. Bislang habe ich ihn aber noch nicht vermisst.Aufpassen: Die Streulichtblende muss zwingend so angebracht werden, dass die Markierungen übereinstimmen. Sie lässt sich nämlich auch in einer anderen Stellung aufschrauben. Dann sitzt sie allerdings so locker, dass Sie sich bei einigen Aufnahmen selbständig verdreht hat und ich schwarze Schatten im Bild hatte. Darauf also unbedingt bei der Benutzung achten.Auch sitzt der Objektivdeckel unter Umständen sehr locker und man kann ihn verlieren, wenn man nicht aufpasst. Da also unbedingt auch noch Mal den korrekten Sitz kontrollieren, dann klappt auch das.Aber auch diese beiden Punkte sind eigentlich Kleinigkeiten und können mir den Spaß an der Linse nicht verderben.Für den Preis 1a und eine unbedingte Empfehlung für den ambitionierten Hobby-Fotografen. Ich habe lange mit mir gehadert, aber die Anschaffung letztendlich nicht bereut.Die Garantieverlängerung über die Sigma-Webseite verlief problemlos (wie schon bei den anderen Sigma-Produkten) und ich hatte die Garantieurkunde für 3 Jahre sofort nach der Registrierung."
Marc,,Calidad y luminosidad,"Es un objetivo indispensable si tienes una APS-C. Parece algo limitado de distancia focal, pero teniendo en cuenta que se trata de un equivalente a 27-52mm creo que es un objetivo muy practico. Hace unos retratos macnificos con una proporción muy natural. El bokeh es muy bueno y con 1.8 tenemos muy poca profundidad de campo, esto a veces es un inconveniente pero lo compensa con luminosidad. La unica pega... que no lo puedes usar en una Full Frame sin malgastar una gran parte de megapíxeles. Si tienes una full frame de 36 o más, ya no importa. Por este precio, no hay discusión, una gran compra."

Brennweitebereichen) mit ""Standartlichtstärke"".Das Fehlen eines Verwackelungsschutzes bei diesem Sigma störte bislang auch bei nicht ganz einfachen Lichtverhältnissen in keiner Weise.Dafür scheint der Autofocus in der Tat eine Spur langsamer zu sein als bei den Canon's.Einziger Kritikpunkt wäre beim versandbedingten Fehlen eines Händlerstempels im beigepackten Garantieaufkleber anzumerken. Laut Beipackzettel gewährt SIGMA die 3 Jahres Garantie nur, wenn besagter Aufkleber ausgefüllt vom Verkäufer auf der Garantiekarte aufgebracht zusammen mit dem Kaufbeleg vorgelegt werden kann. Von Onlineregistrierung war in den Herstellerunterlagen nichts zu lesen.Nach einigem hin und her erklärte die Amazon Technikabteilung schriftlich, dass ein Ausdruck des Lieferscheines genüge, und ein anderer Amazon KD-Mitarbeiter erklärten schriftlich, dass notfalls Amazon die Ansprüche übernehmen würde.Ach ja - die Packung war ganz normal - keine Schwärzungen etc. bei den Garantiesiegeln."
Angel,,"Gran objetivo,el mejor para formato DX","Calidades de materiales excepcionales,no tiene nada que ver con mis otros objetivos Nikon aunque claro no valen lo que este.Calidad de imagen cuando quiere enfocar bien muy buena,aunque e tenido que devolverlo por problemas de enfoque,back y front focus que me a fastidiado algunos trabajos de retrato,y para el precio que pagué me niego a andarme por las ramas y lo e devuelto.Cuando me llegó el paquete la caja tanto de Amazon como la que contenía el objetivo estaban un poco magulladas,y el objetivo me vino con la tapa donde se conecta a la cámara suelto,indicios que nada mas verlos tenía que haberlo devuelto pero le di una oportunidad,aunque fallida.Espero que la siguiente unidad que pida no me venga con estos problemas.Le pongo 2 estrellas porque el objetivo es de mucha calidad,lo que me faltó esque funcionase bien.____________________EDITADO:Esta unidad enviada y vendida por Amazon si me a llegado en condiciones,ahora si aprecio las grandes bondades que brinda este objetivo con mi D7200. Muy recomendado y de gran calidad en todos los sentidos."
Chris Dira,,"Optisch top, Fokus flop.","Dieses berüchtigte Objektiv ist superscharf auch bei Offenblende. Es erzeugt ein schönes Bokeh und hat überhaupt kaum optische Schwächen. Auch gebaut ist es wie ein Panzer.Allerdings hat es wie viele Sigmaobjektive einen großen Nachteil. Der Autofokus. Ich habe es an der EOS 90D getestet und der Autofokus ist absolut nicht zu gebrauchen. Habe es mit dem Sigma Dock in stundenlanger Justierung versucht richtig einzustellen aber das ist eine Arbeit, die man sich sparen kann, da es, zumindest bei mir, nicht den gewünschten Effekt bringt. Wer filmt und dabei sowieso manuell fokussiert, für den ist dieses Objektiv sicher konkurrenzlos."
Simone T.,,Finalmente uno zoom di qualità per APS-C,"Descivere un prodotto così specifico non è facile, spesso il risultato è determinato dal prodotto ricevuto e dall'accoppiata con il corpo macchina.Il prodotto è stato testato in abbinato ad una canon 70d e non ho dovuto fare alcuna regolazione sulla messa a fuoco (nessun front/back focus)L'obiettivo rientra nella famosa famiglia dei prodotti sigma art della Sigma ed arriva in una comoda e gradevole confezione corredata di involucro in tessuto per il trasporto.Qaulità costruttiva/Peso: Una volta aperta la confezione le prime due caratteristiche che balzano all'occhio è la pregevole fattura del prodotto e il peso dell'obiettivo. La qualità è sicuramente ben al di sopra del 17-55 di casa canon che costa anceh di più e di altri prodotti nella stessa focale. Se fosse stato canon ci avrei visto un bel rigo rosso. Le ghiere sono fluide e la sensazione è di un prodotto dal costo ben supriore a quello di listino. di contro tanta qualità si paga alla bilancia, con un peso veramente imporante. Abbianto ad una 70d e ad un battery grip si fà fatica a tenere l'obiettivo al collo per l'intera giornata. E' necessario un corpo macchina pro per bilanciare tanto peso.Caratteristiche. L'obiettivo è privo di stabilizzatore (che ne avrebbe aumentato ulteriormente prezzo/peso) ma ha un'apertura costante a 1.8, il che lo rende adatto ad una moltitudine di situazione. La messa a fuoco è rapida, silenziosa ed molto precisa a discapito di quanto letto altrove circa il marchio sigma.Ovviamente bisogna considera la profondità di campo ridotta ad f1.8Qualità d'immagine: Sbalorditiva. Vengo da un tamron 17-50 e da un fisso in quella focale, ma qui siamo si altri livelli. A tutta apertura l'obiettivo è usabilissimo e grazie all'apertura ridotta ho portato a casa un gran numero di foto. I colori sono vivi e si ha l'impressione che l'obiettivo necessiti di sensori con risoluzioni più elevate per esprimersi al meglio.La focale ridotta mi spaventava ma l'ho usato per quasi tutto il tempo durante il mio viaggio in irlanda, senza sentirmi mai troppo limitato.Obiettivo con grandi qualità, ma due soli vincoli: Peso e Zoom limitato"
P & I,,Ich ärgere mich schon....,"An sich bildet die Linse gut ab. Kann mich Über die Resultate (wenn sie denn mal scharf sind) nicht beschweren!Problem ist halt einfach der Autofokus....Da kann man halt auch einfach eine Linse direkt ohne Autofokus verkaufen! Bei einer so offenen Blende sieht man halt auch einfach ob der Fokus on Point ist oder nicht und zu meinem Bedauern ist er in den meisten Fälle nicht On Point :( Und ja, ich habe extra den Dock dazu um Feinjustierungen vorzunehmen, dass ist auch nicht das Problem. Vielmehr wird immer auf einen Random Punkt scharfgestellt bei 10 gleichen Bildern hat man dann schonmal drei, vier verschiedenen Fokuspunkte. Auch die verarbeitung ist...nunja...grenzwertig. Wenn nach der ersten Woche Benutzung schon die aufgedruckten Brennweitenziffern abgehen....pfuiAlles in allem kann ich die Linse leider nicht guten Gewissens Empfehlen! Schade!"
Hundefrauchen,,Nicht für Canon - Bei Offenblende 1.8 leider mieser Autofokus,"Dieses Objektiv ging schon nach 2 Tagen testen zurück. Ich war wirklich sehr enttäuscht. Ich hatte es für einen Canon EOS 77D gekauft. Leider gibt es, wie ich nach Kauf und googlen in einigen Foren feststellte, da wohl oft Probleme mit dem Autofokus. Das kann ich -vor allem bei der Offenblende (und DESWEGEN kauft man ja ein lichtstarkes Objektiv)- leider nur bestätigen. Alles was in der Mitte oder im rechten AF Bereich lag, wurde vernünftig fokussiert. Bei den linken Autofokus-Felder trat sofort eine Unschärfe auf, egal wie oft ich es versuchte oder wie ruhig ich die Kamera hielt. An den beiden Bildern wird das gut deutlich, es wurde beides Mal mit 1.8 Blende die Augen des Hundes anvisiert.Der Sigma Support am Telefon war leider unterirdisch maulfaul und nicht serviceorientiert.Viele hier schrieben ja, sie hätten das Problem mit einem USB Dock von Sigma und Selbstkalibrierung behoben... aber mal ehrlich, wenn ich ein Objektiv für 700€ kaufe, dann möchte ich, dass es funktioniert und zwar ohne, dass ich selber eine Fortbildung zum Kameratechniker machen muss.Ging zurück, schade auch, hatte mir viel versprochen, aber Schärfe war nicht besser als bei meinem Canon Kit Objektiv EF-S 18-135mm F3.5-5.6. Da hätte ich mir vom Sigma definitiv mehr versprochen!"
Marcel M.,,Gestochen Scharf und unglaubliche Kontraste,"Ich habe wirklich schon viele Linsen an meiner 77d gehabt. Jedoch kommt keine Festbrennweite (50er 1.8 und 1.4; 85er 1.8; 30er 1.4; 28er 2.0 und 60er Macro 2.8(das noch am ehesten)) an die Schärfe des Sigma 18-35 1.8 ran. Die Bilder sehen teilweise als RAW schon so gut und kontrastreich aus, dass ich kaum noch was machen muss im Lightroom. Leider war der Fokus bei meiner ersten Linse selbst auf dem Sigma-Dock nicht korrigierbar. Bei der Zweiten (Danke Amazon an den top Service) habe ich jedoch kaum Änderungen machen müssen. Der Fokus sitzt perfekt - auch in schlechten Lichtverhältnissen wie Abends auf einer Hochzeit.Klare Kaufempfehlung für jeden APS-C Fotografen.Die Kritik über das hohe Gewicht, kann ich nicht nachvollziehen. Habe das Objektiv auf jeder Bergtour und auch auf mehrtätigen Zelttouren dabei, und es hat mich noch nie gestört. Wer geile Bilder machen will, muss auch etwas mehr tragen können."
BK,,Grandios Ersteindruck bei Indoor-Sport,"Viel zu lange habe ich mich mit billigeren Objektive rumgeschlagen. Brauchte ein lichtstarkes Objektiv und da kam mir das hier von Sigma auf den Schirm.Bei nicht wirklich optimalen Bedingungen was das Licht angeht knallt das Art-Objektiv knackige Bilder raus. Ich bin begeistert.Über langsamen Fokus kann ich bisher noch nicht klagen, aber ich hab es auch erst einen Tag genutzt.Die Bildqualität ist aber über jeden Zweifel erhaben, zumindest für meine Hobby- Ansprüche.Fühlt sich wertig an, man merkt, da steckt einiges an Entwicklung drin.Haptik sehr gut. Neben dem 70-200 Tamron G2 nun mein lieblingsobjektiv.In einigen Wochen werde ich hier nochmal ein Update machen."
of2,,Autofokus enttäuschte leider doch,"Ich hatte mir einige Rezensionen hier genau durchgelesen, besonders die, wo immer wieder von einem nicht einwandfreien Autofokus die Rede war. Habe mich aber dann trotzdem für einen Kauf entschieden, weil ich schon andere Sigma Art Objektive in Gebrauch habe (uA 50mm 1.4 und 85mm 1.4), bei denen auch mancher gesagt hatte, dass der Autofokus eher zufällig mal ein scharfes Bild hin bekommt.Bei diesem Objektiv hier traf es mich jedoch auch. Von gut 200 Auslösungen blieben am Ende grade mal 10 Bilder, bei denen der Fokus mal passte. Selbst bei Nahaufnahmen von Objekten lag er teilweise bis zu 10mm daneben. Ja ich weiß, ich kann es mithilfe des USB Docks kalibrieren, aber warum sollte ich, wenn ich sehe, dass es anhand meiner anderen Sigma Objektiven auch anders geht? Ich denke mal, dass der Unterschied hier einfach in der Festbrennweite liegt. Ich werde mir in Zukunft, wenn Sigma, dann nur noch Festbrennweiten zulegen. Die Funktionieren wenigstens.Ansonsten: Optik, Haptik und Qualität des Objektivs sind sehr gut, wie bei meinen anderen auch. Nur die Funktion ist nicht gegeben."
Christine Brehm u. Michael Böhrs,,"Superscharf, natürliche Bildwirkung -aber...","Ich hatte anfangs noch keinen Fehlfocus festgestellt (das Problem ist ja bekannt), aber nach einigen Wochen im Einsatz fiel mir eine z.T. deutliche Unschärfe auf und im Vergleich mit Liveview-Bildern war der Unterschied eindeutig. Also musste dasDocking-Teil her, mit dem ich das Objekiv dann kalibriert habe. Hat mich zwei Stunden Arbeit gekostet, die sich allerdings gelohnt hat. Trotzdem bleibt ein ungutes Gefühl zurück. Ich hoffe, dass mein Objektiv jetzt so bleibt und nicht wieder mit Frontfocus herumzickt."
Jas,,Sharp Is The Name Of The Game,"This lens outperforms any other apsc lens out there. F1.8 makes it feel effortless to be shooting hand held at night time and to get crystal clear images woth the ability to use faster shutter speeds...and all this on a zoom lens. Sigma will be a major player in the upcoming years. They have their business model set up right, great quality, affordability and not ""holding back"" with their top innovations for just flagship models. Pretty much every new fast sigma lens nowadays IS a Flagship model . This particular model is so sharp that it is visible that i would be able to handle more than a 24mp camera (that i am currently using)"
Sonam Yamphel ,,Sharp !!!,This leans oh yeah baby it’s sharp and it’s great. Mostly probably you should know how to use it . 80% the lens does it’s job other 20% you should know how to use it. Overall It’s must have for APSC camera Like the Canon 80D.
Nicolò Frasca,,"Ottimo se usato su sensori APS-C, non adatto a sensori FULL FRAME","Come da titolo ho comprato questo obiettivo Sigma per la mia Nikon D610. Purtroppo ho dovuto effettuare il reso perché nell'entusiasmo dell'acquisto non mi sono reso conto che fosse per camere con sensore APS-C. La resa sul Full Frame dimezzandosi i megapixels e aumentando il range in MM era praticamente oscena per il prezzo dell'obiettivo. Dunque, mi sento di sconsigliarlo per chi possiede una reflex/mirrorless FX, mentre per chi possiede quest'ultime con sensore APS-C compratelo immediatamente perché credo sia il migliore zoom sul mercato. Ottimo per fare scatti stupendi ma altrettanto valido per girare video. Per quanto riguarda l'obiettivo in sé, nulla da dire. Qualità costruttiva ottima. Leggermente pesante ma davvero bello."
Jeshuafan,,Der scharfe Weit-/Standardwinkel-Klassiker für Film und Foto,"Ein Objektiv sowohl für Film als auch im Potraitbereich, in der Produktfotografie und sogar im Makro-Bereich (mit Zwischenringen) einfach top. Der Autofocus ist langsam, aber läuft. Wunderschöne softe Bokehs und eine enorme Schärfe zeichnen diese Objektiv aus. Schade, dass es nicht direkt für Sony E angeboten wird, aber Sony A oder Canon EOS mit den jeweiligen Adaptern laufen an der Sony Alpha 7 III auch. Bei 35 mm lässt sich das Objektiv auch ohne Crop im Vollformat nutzen."
Alberto Bi,,Lo ho adorato,"Credo sia uno due miei obbiettivi preferiti, molto nitido, pesa parecchio ma offre grande soddisfazioni. L'incognita rimane sempre la presenza di f/b focus ed il mio esemplare ne soffriva terribilmente. Con una calibrazione tramite dock son riuscito a sistemare il range di focus fino a 3 metri, oltre non son riuscito a dargli una calibrazione accurata, la seconda opzione era mandarlo in assistenza a mie spese per una taratura in laboratorio insieme al corpo macchina, mio malgrado dati i tempi son stato costretto a renderlo e mi è rimasto sempre sul cuore. Prima o poi provvederò a ricomprarlo"
Sanchez Rémy,,Ravis,"Magnifique! Objet. robuste. Superbe piqué. Il est meilleur que celui de mes focales fixes Canon (50mm STM et 24mm STM).Un zoom d'une tel qualité, c'est juste géniale! Je ne met pas 5 car j'ai un gros regret. Il ne fonctionne qu'avec les APS-C...édit de mon commentaire précédant: J'ai beaucoup travaillé avec cet objectif.. Il n'a aucun problème de front focus on back focus... Quand l'auto focus fonctionne..! Les photos sont prises correctement quand soudain, sans que l'on sache pourquoi, le focus ne se fait tout simplement pas... Au début j'ai cru que le problème venait de moi... Mais après plusieurs utilisations, c'est typique de cet objectif. l'auto focus Sigma est clairement défaillant. Je n'ai jamais eu de problème avec la marque Tamron que je site ici car c'est une marque tiers, je ne parle même pas de mes objectif Canon qui fonctionnent PARFAITEMENT... un tel prix pour un AF défaillent ce n'est pas normal... quand on connait le problème on peut le contourner, focus sur un sujet très prêt puis de nouveau sur le sujet voulu et ça repart, mais ne comptez pas sur cet objectif pour une utilisation professionnel. Il n'est pas digne de confiance..."
Jose Candela,,No recomendable para la GH5,"Lo compré esperando una gran calidad de imagen junto al adaptador Viltrox EF-M2 y lo que encontré fue un viñeteado con la máxima apertura que no fui capaz de solucionar. Por otra parte, el autoenfoque es casi inexistente y muy lento por lo que todo tiene que grabarse en modo manual.Supongo que con cámaras canon funcionará mejor pero mi experiencia no ha sido positiva."
Fernando S.,,"No es la cámara, es el cristal","Ok, es un objetivo en formato DX y parece que todo el mundo estamos obligados a pasar a full frame. Pero si tienes una DX reciente o has decidido que te vas a mantener en ese formato (en el que se siguen fabricando cámaras brutales), este objetivo es CREMA. Nitidez de primera división, construcción de magnífica calidad, y todo por un precio más que contenido teniendo en cuenta las alternativas. Es grande para las focales? Pesa? Sí y sí, pero es que el vidrio pesa, y aquí no hay lentes de plástico."
Jonathan Hatlen,,Great lens for different types of shoots.,"Love this lens. I use it for night time shoots (stars) and landscapes. It's f1.8 throughout its 18-35 range is great. It doesn't come with image stabilization which for me is fine as I use a tripod. It is just ever so heavyer then my 18-200 Canon lens that is my ever day lens. I have it attach to a Canon rebel t6i. I think for the price it great, it let me take out 2 other lens from my backpack which means it becomes lighter and the nice low light capability makes for nice clean photos in different settings. Attach are photos that I took with the lens. I just cropped the photos and adjusted the brightness so the stars pop more."
Vittorio,,Semplicemente eccezionale!,"Avevo letto di seri problemi di autofocus su Nikon e Pentax, pertanto ero un pò preoccupato per questo acquisto e temevo di doverlo restituire, ma pare che mi sia andata bene e non ci siano problemi.La qualità di questa lente è semplicemente scioccante, già a 1.8 è davvero una lama, nitidissimo e sfruttabilissimo su tutto il range di focali, qualcosa da non crederci!C'è un pò di vignettatura, in particolare a tutta apertura e 18mm (resta tuttavia a tutte le focali), che però non mi dispiace, non ha davvero nulla da invidiare a moltissimi fissi di fascia alta (e ne ho usati diversi). Aberrazioni cromatiche controllatissime, praticamente assenti, AF silenzioso, rapido e preciso.Uno zoom che sostituisce degnamente 3 fissi, 18, 24 e 35mm.Assolutamente consigliato a tutti!"
Rev,,Non c'è lente migliore per questo prezzo,"Una lente mitica. Non c'è paragone per questa fascia di prezzo fino al suo doppio...Una nitidezza unica e una versatilità senza paragoni.Lavora benissimo su GH5/BMPCC 4k con speedbooster.Con poche centinaia di euro, come una prime, comprate una lente di una versatilità e luminosità senza paragoni.Comprate un ND perché la lente fa giorno anche di notte e di giorno non vorrete sempre chiudere l'apertura."
Rocky,,"8 because that was the cheaper solution to have better images, you will freakout with sigma 18-35 1","If you had a lot of time used to the not so clear 18-135 (3.5 - 5.6) or 18-55 (3.5 - 5.6) and bought a 50mm 1.8 because that was the cheaper solution to have better images, you will freakout with sigma 18-35 1.8. Have clear images even zooming!"
Mirella,,MAL AUTOENFOQUE,"El objetivo vino en buenísimas condiciones por parte de Amazon y parecía tener una calidad y una robustez magníficas, pero al poco de probarlo pude apreciar el terrible problema de front-focus que tenía. Por eso mismo, solicité un cambio y Amazon respondió de maravilla facilitándome otra lente sin coste alguno. Sin embargo, el problema continuó con la nueva lente, por lo que puedo concluir con que es un error de estos objetivos, ya que además ya he leído varias opiniones de este tipo.Doy dos estrellas porque conozco gente a la que le ha salido bien la lente y están encantados con la misma, además de por la buena atención recibida por parte de Amazon."
dvigna2b,,un must have!,"Professionnel vidéo (gh5+métabones 0,71)Jen 'ai pas hésité lors de l'achat de cet objectif car je l'avais déjà eu en mains lors d'un tournage.C'est un bon investissement sur un capteur APS-C ou encore un M4/3 avec une bague d'adaptation.J'ai aimé:la Bague de mise au point large et soupleLe rendu du piqué (ni trop sharp, ni trop mou)Avec un plage focale (ma config) 25-53mm je couvre pas mal de situations. Accouplé avec un speedbooster le 1.8 devient un 1.2 et on y rajoute un filtre ND et là c'est parfait. Bien sur il reste l'effet de pompage lors de l'utilisation du zoom manuel en vidéo mais c'est le propre des objectifs photo."
Christian Albrecht,,Top Objektiv!,"Das Objektiv ist mein neues Immer-Drauf-Objektiv an meiner Nikon D7100 APSC Sensor. Die Verarbeitung ist sehr hochwertig, Autofokus schnell und die Bildergebnis sind auf dem Niveau von Festbrennweiten! Aufgrund der Lichtstärke bishin zu Weitwinkelaufnahme kommt es dem Look einer Vollformatkamera sehr nah! Hat meine ""alte"" ApSC Kamera auf jeden Fall deutlich aufgewertet und mich vom Kauf eines neuen Bodys abgehalten! Top! Zu beachten ist jedoch, das das Objektiv keinen Bildstabilisator hat! Für meine Art der Fotografie stellt das jedoch kein Problem dar."
David,,Super scharfes Objektiv,"Das Objektiv ist super scharf, damit lassen sich wirklich schöne Fotos machen. Ich verwende es hauptsächlich für Landschaft.Ein Manko ist der Autfokus, dieser musst bei meiner Kombination (Nikon D500 und D7500) über das Sigma Dock angepasst werden um gute Ergebniss zu liefern. Meist verwende ich das Objektiv jedoch mit manuellem Fokus, der große Fokusring erlaubt ein sehr gutes Fokussieren.Weiters ist das Objektiv sehr hochwertig verarbeitet (Metall), dadurch jedoch auch schwer. Das ist wohl der Preis für eine überragende Bildschärfe. Vergleichbare Schärfe habe ich noch bei keinem Zoomobjektiv gesehen, nur bei Festbrennweiten.Chromatische Abberationen sind mir kaum welche aufgefallen. Sonnensterne auf Blende 16 gibt es sehr schöne.Leider hat das Objektiv am Bajonettanschluss keine Abdichtung gegen Staub und Feuchtigkeit, bei meinem Einsatzgebiet ist das jedoch nicht weiter schlimm.Ich bin mit dem Objektiv sehr zufrieden und kann es jedem empfehlen der mal super scharfe Bilder machen möchte."
hlb,,Autofocus qui n accroche pas,"Comme beaucoup j ai des problèmes d autofocus. Je ne parle pas des micros ajustements que j ai pu réglé sur mon boitier (canon 80d).Je parle de l autofocus qui, sans comprendre pourquoi, se fait par moment bien avant ou après le sujet.Je n ai jamais eu de problème sur tous mes autres objectifs.J ai fait hier une sortie photo. Sur environ 100 photos prises avec le canon 70-200 f4 et 100 autres avec le sigma, j ai environ 15% de pertes sur le sigma contre 0 sur le canon.Et quand on se fait violence pour se lever très tôt le matin pour capter les goldenhour, et qu au retour, on mets avec impatience ses photos dans LR, et qu on s aperçoit que les meilleurs sont flous et inexploitables....Ça vous donne qu une envie, ranger cet objectif dans le placard et ne plus jamais l utiliser....Je préfère avoir 100% de mes photos de bonnes qualités et nettes, plutôt que 85% d excellent qualité mais avec un gros taux de déchets....qui peuvent tomber sur les meilleurs clichés."
Yvo,,Must-Have-Objektiv,"Eine wunderbare Erfahrung mit solch einem qualitiv hochwertigen Objektiv Fotos von Mensch und Natur zu machen, durch den großen Brennweitenbereich ist es von Natur- über Tier- bis hin zu Portraitfotografie eine AllzweckwaffeDer Autofokus ist bei meiner Kamera einer EOS 80D absolut in Ordnung wenn auch nicht BlitzschnellDie Abbildungsleistung dagegen überragend da alle Bilder über eine sehr schöne Schärfentiefe verfügenDie Qualität ist ebenso mehr als Ausgezeichnet, sehr Griffig an den Einstellungmanschetten und Wertig in der HandPreis-/Leistung absolut top"
Andreas Wendt,,brilliantes Objektiv,"Das Objektiv ist hervorragend verarbeitet. Die ersten Fotoserien an einer Nikon D7200 haben mich überzeugt. Der fehlende automatische Bildstabilisator stört mich nicht. Mein Fokus liegt eindeutig auf der Schärfe und vor allem der Lichtempfindlichkeit. F1.8, ist schon eine Ansage. In lichtschwachen Situationen bin ich aber trotzdem auf einen festen Standpunkt angewiesen (Stativ). Die Ergebnisse aber überzeugen mich. Ist eben nicht für eine „Knipse“ ;-) Für schnelle Situationen nehme ich eh mein Mobil Tel."
Mathieu ,,"Qualité  pour duré, bonne investissement",Je savais que le 18-35 de sigma avait une bonne réputation mais il est mieu que je pensait. L'image est tellement nette (sharp). Vous devrez par contre acheter le module usb pour faire des ajustements sur le focus. Le commentaires général est vrai et vous devrez avoir un peu de patience. Mais ca en vaut la peine
Andrea,,"Ottimo in tutto, tranne nel peso","Utilizzo questa lente ormai diventata un must da 5 anni e principalmente per i video... è una garanzia di qualità, quasi come un'ottica Cinema, specialmente se utilizzata con un lens reducer. Ecco, ovviamente non vi aspettate nulla di particolarmente ""comodo"", per quanto riguarda dimensioni e peso (ho una GH5 e pesa decisamente più della camera). Dunque poco adatto per il ""run and gun"", ma per lavori un po' più controllati, è senza dubbio la lente col miglior rapporto qualità-prezzo."
UggaAgga,,Heidewitzka wie daneben kann ein Fokus nur liegen ?!,"Komplette Katastrophe bei offen Blende. Ich habe gerade das Sigma Objektiv erhalten und auf allen Brennweiten offenblendig die Schärfe mittels Autofokus getestet. Nur auf einer Brennweite von 28mm passte die Fokussierung 100%ig auf allen anderen Brennweiten gab es Differenzen von bestimmt 5cm und mehr. Über das zusätzliche Dock alles zu auf 5 Entfernungen mit 5 Brennweiten zu konfiguieren habe ich keine Lust und kaufe mir lieber ein Produkt von einem anderen Hersteller. Gerne hätte ich dem Sigma Service telefonisch noch um Rat befragt aber, da geht heute keiner ans Telefon..."
THHO,,Mega Objektiv,"Habe das Objektiv für die A6300 mit einem entsprechenden A-Mount Adapter gekauft. Ich hatte zuvor einige lichtstarke Objektive getestet und war von allen eher enttäuscht (Samyang 21mm, Sony Sel35). Von dem Sigma war ich sehr beeindruckt. Mit 18mm ist es nicht wahnsinnig weitwinklig, das ist ein wenig schade. Die Lichtstärke sowie die Bildqualität haben mich absolut überzeugt. Der Autofokus wollte gelengentlich (ehr selten) nicht so wie ich, war dennoch absolut zuverlässig. Das Gewicht ist im Vergleich zu anderen Objektiven schwer, die Kamera verschwindet fast schon dahinter. Hat mir aber dennoch ganz gut gefallen. Die Verarbeirung ist sehr wertig und fast besser als die hauseigenen Objektive. Ich würde eine absolute Empfehlung für Hobbyfotografen wie mich geben, vorausgesetzt man ist bereit, den Preis (fast 900€ mit Adapter) zu bezahlen"
paulo,,"Muy buena calidad de imagen, mal autoenfoque","Seguramente me ha tocado la china, pero el autoenfoque de esta lente no funciona demasiado bien. Casi puedo decir que si no fuese porque mi cámara (canon 70d) tiene un sistema de enfoque en live view muy bueno, la habría devuelto, ya que enfocar con aperturas por debajo de 3 a través del visor es una lotería. He leído pruebas en las que dicen que el autoenfoque funciona muy bien, así que como ya he dicho seguramente me ha tocado una unidad mala.La llevaré más adelante en garantía para ver si lo pueden arreglar. He calibrado el auto enfoque para esta lente en mi cámara y ha mejorado algo, pero sigue siendo bastante inconsistente, sobretodo si disparas entre 1.8 y 3. Para asegurarme de que las fotos quedan bien enfocadas utilizo casi siempre live view cuando disparo con aperturas grandes. Aunque con live view las fotos quedan bien enfocadas, la lente es bastante lenta en enfocar en comparación con otras lentes Canon, en ocasiones le puede llevar más de un segundo.En cuanto a la calidad de imagen la verdad es que es muy buena, es muy nítida casi en cualquier focal y en cualquer apertura y supera claramente a todas las otras lentes que tengo. La construcción es genial, da gusto tocarla, los anillos de enfoque y de zoom tienen un tacto eléctrico. Pesa bastante, pero yo me he acostumbrado rápido."
Amazon Kunde,,Macht einfach Laune :-),1. Wenn man Schärfe möchte - bitteschön2. Top Bildqualität3. Top Autofokus4. Ist natürlich ein globiges und schweres Objektiv (weiß man aber vorher)5. Würde mir ein 18-55 f1.8 wünschen (35mm sind manchmal etwas knapp aber weiß man auch vorher)6. Eins der besten Objekive für APSC(nutze es zum Fotografieren an einer Canon 600D)
Alessandro G.,,Obiettivo eccezionale!,"Ho acquistato questo obiettivo dopo un'accurata ricerca nel web, tra forum e recensioni video di professionisti.L'obiettivo è bello solido, pesante (molto pesante), costruito con materiali di qualità e curato nei dettagli.L'autofocus è silenziosissimo e fluido, così come lo scorrere della ghiera. La risoluzione è impressionante, così come la luminosità.N.B.: tale obiettivo ha notoriamente dei problemi di taratura di messa a fuoco (difetto che ho riscontrato anche nel mio esemplare), ma si può correggere tranquillamente con dei metodi fai-da-te economici o acquistando l'apposito dock. Nulla di grave quindi, forse un po' noioso. Comunque sono veramente soddisfatto dell'acquisto e Amazon non ha tradito le mie aspettative, neppure questa volta."
Jazz Gitti,,Superscharfe lichtstarke Linse,"Habe mir die Linse als Canon-Mount für meine Canon EOS 800d geholt. Im Vorhinein bereiteten mir natürlich die zahlreich hier in den Rezensionen geschilderten Fälle mehr- oder minder ausgeprägten FF/BF‘s einige Sorgen. Aufgrund der Paramater der Linse, die nun mal für sich sprechen und es im APS-C-Format keine Alternative gibt, habe ich es mir bestellt.Lieferung/Verpackung in gewohnter Amazon-Manier - bombenfest und sicher. Registrierung des Objektivs bei SIGMA ohne Probleme, keine geschwärzten Seriennummern, beschädigten Kartons o.Ä.Keine FF/BF-Probleme der Linse in Verbindung mit meiner DSLR. Ein Nachjustieren oder Kalibrieren entfiel somit. Die Lichtstärke ist, so wie auch die Schärfe, der Hammer. Haptik wertig und überzeugend.Ich für meinen Teil bin super zufrieden und natürlich fiel mir ein Stein vom Herzen, als ich nach dem Auspacken feststellte, dass es keine Probleme mit dem AF gab.Kann jedem, der sich über eine Beschaffung Gedanken macht, nur zum Kauf raten!Drücke natürlich jedem die Daumen dass es, so wie bei mir, keine bösen Überraschungen mit dem AF gibt :-)"
Dirk,,Sehr gutes Objektiv,Ich habe den Kauf nicht bereut.Das Objektiv ist zu meiner Nummer 1 von meinen Objektiven geworden.Es ist sehr scharf in der Abbildung. Super für Landschaft und Nachtaufnahmen geeignet.Klar ich musste das Objektiv an meine Sony A77ii anpassen das ging zwar nicht schnell aber danach war es einfach perfekt
Terra,,Ein Superobjektiv,"Über diese Objektiv wurde eigentlich alles schon geschrieben. Nach einer Woche und vielen Fotos mit unterschiedlichen Einstellungen bin ich absolut begeistert. Das Pech, dass einige mit dem Autofokus haben, habe ich an meiner Nikon D7500 nicht. Der Fokus sitzt perfekt, sowohl im Phasen Fokus (Sucher), als auch im Kontrast Fokus (Liveview). Die Schärfe, selbst bei Offenblende, ist einfach umwerfend. Ebenso ist das Freistellen im Nahbereich genial. Eine leichte Vignettierung bei Offenblende ist zwar vorhanden, aber die lässt sich mit Adobe Lightroom mit einem Mausklick beseitigen.Beim Kauf der Nikon D7500 habe ich das (AF-S Nikkor 18-200mm 1:3,5-5,6 GII ED) dazugekauft. Das ist schon ein wertiges Objektiv, kann es aber mit dem Sigma, im entsprechenden Brennweitenbereich, nicht aufnehmen.Da ich mich zukünftig mit dem Thema Zeitraffer- und Astrofotografie beschäftigen möchte, ist dieses Objektiv aufgrund seiner Schärfe und Lichtstärke eine gute Voraussetzung.Fazit: Absolute Kaufempfehlung."
mojoman,,Sehr gute Linse,"Nutze das Objektiv mit einer Blackmagic Pocket 4k, alles cool. Habe sehr schöne Bilder damit produziert. Autofokus und Bildstabilisierung werden hier leider nicht unterstützt, daher kann ich dazu keine Aussagen machen. Schärfe und Bokeh gefallen mir aber sehr gut. Ich würde die Linse wieder kaufen."
H. Brand,,Anfällig für Lens Flares,"Ich bin mit dem Objektiv was die Schärfe und Lichtstärke betrifft sehr zufrieden. Auch offenblendig gibt es schöne Ergebnisse. Das Objektiv fühlt sich haptisch sehr hochwertig an, der Fokusring läuft geschmeidig. Den Fokus selbst empfinde ich jetzt nicht als langsam und er ist auch treffsicher.Was mich allerdings sehr stört ist die extreme Lens Flare Anfälligkeit bei Gegenlicht. In dieser Preisklasse erwarte ich ehrlich gesagt bessere Ergebnisse, andere Hersteller bekommen es ja auch besser hin. Ebenso schade ist, dass es nicht spritzwassergeschützt ist."
gionge,,"Obiettivo Sigma 18-35 F/1,8","Dopo aver visto su vari forum i commenti degli utilizzatori mi sono deciso ad acquistare questo obiettivo. Sorpreso dal suo peso e dalla lunghezza per uno zoom così 'corto'. L'autofocus è silenzioso e anche veloce. La mancanza dello stabilizzatore va a vantaggio della nitidezza che è assolutamente eccezzionale. Controllata ache a computer veramente super. Non si può usare il flash della fotocamera perche l'obiettivo fa ombra, ma questo non è importante perchè io uso un flash esterno. Sono completamente soddisfatto di questo acquisto."

Verarbeitung, Lichtstärke, Schärfe auf dem oberstem Niveau.Das Objektiv bekommt allerdings nur 4 Sterne, da ich es mit dem USB Dock erst ordentlich einstellen musste (Zeitaufwand ca. 3 Stunden). Nachdem ich den Frontfocus weg bekommen habe, entpuppte sich das Objektiv als Schärfewunder. Ich setze es fast mit meinem EF 100mm 2.8 L Macro gleich und das heißt schon was."
Cornelis Beets,,Autofocus issues,"The Sigma 18-35mm I received did not (auto-)focus consistently on my Canon 7D Mark II, especially at the wide end (18-24mm). Through other reviews I've read about this. I still ordered this lens as it's potentially a great lens - unique, fast, constant aperture, great IQ - and I hoped that either Sigma addressed the issue in later copies or the inconsistencies were small enough to be acceptable. Unfortunately the issue was not fixed and the inconsistencies were not small. In one of the test shot series I made at f/4 the lens focused at ~1.5m about 50% of the time for a subject at ~3.5m that supposedly had acquired focus. The other 50% it backfocused... Note: it's not possible to correct these issues with AFMA on your camera or with the optional USB dock.I do own a Sigma 35mm prime lens (Art series). That lens does not focus consistently either but the variances are acceptable to me. I use that lens a lot and learned to live with a certain miss rate (which depends mainly on available light, focus point(s) used and scene complexity). The fast aperture, attractive price and great IQ more than make up for the poorer (compared to similar Canon lenses) autofocus performance.I do own various other (Canon) lenses, including fast primes, that do not exhibit this behaviour."
DIEGO V,,NITIDEZ Y CALIDAD BRUTAL,"ME FLIPA! Es otro mundo este objetivo, el bokeh que produce es impresionante, lo utilizo sobre todo para vídeo en entrevistas con una Panasonic Eva1 y es ACOJONANTE! Mejor que mi 70-200 f2.8 IS II para flipar la nitidez y desenfoque que produce en el fondo a 1,8!En foto no lo he probado mucho pero no he visto el problema que suelen comentar de front/back focus"
Cliente,,Serie ART para DX - ME ENCANTA,"Lo compré en octubre, después de 8 meses usándolo, no he tenido problemas ni de desenfoque ni aberraciones ni nada por el estilo.Es todo lo que puede esperarse de la gama ARTLo recomiendo totalmente"
Iu Vela,,Un antes y un después,"Esto es lo que yo llamo un misil tierra-aire. Súper versátil. Mis fotos y vídeos han dado un salto bastante heavy. Que la apertura se mantenga en todo su recorrido lo hace perfecto para casi cualquier situación. Recomiendo un filtro para poder usar su máxima apertura cuando hace mucho sol. En vídeo los resultados son muy buenos y el auto focus va fino catalino, y eso que uso un adaptador MC-11 para mi Alpha 6500. Pesa bastante, pero mi gimbal todavía soporta todo el equipo."

Julian P,,"Geniale Bildqualität, schöner Bokeh","Die Bildqualität ist genial und steht sehr guten Kleinbild-Objektiven in nichts nach. Auch in schlechten Lichtverhältnissen sind tolle Aufnahmen möglich. Gerade für Makro-Aufnahmen und Portraits ist das Objektiv genial mit sehr hohen Details und einem schönen Bokeh.Leider ist das Objektiv sehr schwer - nicht selten bereute ich auf Reisen die Entscheidung, dieses Objektiv mitgenommen zu haben, jedoch kommen immer wieder Situationen, in denen ich es nicht missen möchte."
Diego G.,,Obiettivo eccezionale,"Fra i migliori obiettivi senza alcun dubbio per formato DX. Bello già da vedere, è perfettamente nitido, come solitamente si fa notare. L'ho preso a 560 euro, quindi una buona occasione. Avevo paura per il noto problema del f/b focus, ma il mio non ha questo difetto.Certo la lunghezza focale è un po' limitata, certo il peso si fa sentire...ma restituisce foto ottime e l'apertura fissa a 1.8 ti permette di lavorare a diaframmi sempre aperti. Quando torni sugli altri obiettivi, la differenza si sente eccome...Spedizione ottima e pacco assicurato bene. Quindi soddisfatto per tutto quanto."
Nicholas,,Straordinaria,"Davvero Straordinaria. Ma sono andato a colpo sicuro. Oramai giro i video quasi esclusivamente con questa ottica specialmente a 35mm forse me l'aspettavo più leggera. Però va bene così. Qualità indiscussa. Rispetto alle ottiche luminose canon è più dettagliata e colori piu freddi. Forse limitata se si è abitanti a stare lontani dal soggetto, ma che qualità ragazzi. Consigliatissimo."
Simone De Stefani,,Eccellente,"Aquistato insieme all'adattatore MC-11 per montarlo su Sony a6500. L'obiettivo è importante e piuttosto pesante (da considerare la lunghezza extra dell'adattatore nel mio specifico caso), ma la qualità che offre è assolutamente strabiliante. Nitidezza incredibile anche a TA su tutta la lunghezza focale. Posseggo anche un Sigma 30 f1.4 e mount, ma posso dire che questo obiettivo zoom offre prestazioni superiori alla lente fissa.Unico difetto è la messa a fuoco che non sempre è impeccabile nelle condizioni di luce peggiori, ma non ho mai dovuto rinunciare ad uno scatto per questo motivo.Ottima costruzione generale anche se le zone satinate trattengono un po' troppe impronte e generano quell'effetto unto non piacevole alla vista, ma con un semplice panno da occhiali si ovvia al problema in pochi secondi.Nella confezione viene fornita una pratica custodia per il trasporto ed il paraluce.A questo prezzo è il miglior compromesso su mirrorless Sony per chi cerca uno zoom di alta qualità."
Marcos G.,,Encantado,El objetivo es una pasada en cuanto a velocidad de enfoque y nitidez.Nada que envidiar a los Nikon. La serie Art funciona perfectamente.Imagen muy limpia
Lars1990,,Gutes Objektiv mit kleinen Abstrichen,"Ich habe mir das Objektiv für meine Nikon D7100 gekauft und glaube, dass ich jetzt nach ein paar Monaten testens mal eine Rezension verfassen kann, was ich nicht oft tue. Da mir die Fotografie jedoch sehr am Herzen liegt muss ich einfach mal etwas schreiben. Zur Verarbeitungsqualität wurde in den vorhergehenden Rezensionen denke ich bereits mehr als genug gesagt und diese wurde sehr gelobt. Kein Wunder, denn (um das hier noch einmal kurz zu sagen) die Verarbeitung ist wirklich ein Traum. Ein extrem solides, hochwertiges Stück schwarz schimmernden Metalls mit einer wunderbaren Gummierung des Fokus- und Zoomringes, welche auch für einen sehr sehr angenehmen Widerstand beim Drehen sorgen. Auch der Autofokusschalter an der Seite des Objektives hat einen sehr schönen festen Sitz, da wackelt nichts. Der einzige Wermutstropfen ist hier an der Stelle wirklich das fehlende ""weather sealing"". Natürlich wusste ich das schon vor dem Kauf, nur verstehe ich dies persönlich nicht, dass Sigma so top verarbeiteten Objektiven wie den aus der Art-Serie keinerlei Schutz gegen spritzwasser oder ähnliches spendiert, so wie es nur in der Sportserie der Fall ist. Ich persönlich würde gerne einen Aufpreis bezahlen, wenn mein Objektiv dafür gegen äußere Einflüsse in einem gewissen Maß geschützt wäre.Zur Abbildungsleistung muss hier auch nicht mehr viel hinzugefügt werden. Schon die Schärfe bei Offenblende ist unglaublich, sofern der Fokus trifft. Genau an dieser Stelle muss ich einen halben Stern (wenn man so will) abziehen, denn der Autofkus ist zumindest an meinem Exemplar nicht der Treffsicherste. Dabei kommt es hier auf die jeweilige Aufnahmesituation an. Wenn es sich um sehr kontrasreiche Objekte handelt, trifft er Autofokus fast immer. Wird das Licht auch nur etwas schwächer bzw. die Szene etwas kontrastärmer sind nur noch ca. 70% der Aufnahmen scharf. Das kann das 16-35mm Objektiv (welches ich auch besitze) bei gleicher Blende und Brennweite besser. Dies ist von der Abbildungsleistung her jedoch an der Nikon D7100 nicht so gut wie das Sigma. Was nützt einem die Schärfe des Sigmas jedoch, wenn der Autofokus doch recht unzuverlässig ist. Die AF-Geschwindigkeit ist hier jedoch wirklich in Ordnung und auch chromatische Aberrationen (Farbsäume) sind sehr gut kontrolliert. Natürlich sind auch diese vorhanden aber in dem geringen Maße, dass sie ohne Probleme über Software entfernt werden können.Des Weiteren ist mir aufgefallen, dass nur die sich im Zentrum des AF-Moduls befinden Fokuspunkte wirklich verwendet werden können. Dies sind zum einen natürlich die Kreuzsensoren aber auch die, die direkt daneben liegen. Bei allen anderen Fokuspunkten, die weiter am Rand liegen taucht hier doch ein extrem starker Fehlfolkus auf. Da ich jedoch Landschaftsfotograf bin ist diese Tatsache nicht so tragisch, da ich ohnehin die meiste Zeit mit dem zentralen Fokuspunkt arbeite, spricht fokussiere und dann meine Komposition aufbaue. Jedoch sollte so etwas nicht vorkommen. Bei meinen anderen Objektiven klappt dies ja auch.Den anderen halben Stern muss ich an der Stelle abziehen, was die sogenannten ""flares"" (Streulicht) bei Gegenlichtaufnahmen angeht. Diese sind doch gerade bei Aufnahmen von Sonnenuntergängen / Sonnenaufgängen zum Teil sehr kontrastreich und für mich recht störend. Es gibt natürlich tricks, wie man so etwas auf seinen Aufnahmen komplett vermeiden kann, sofern man mit einem Stativ fotografiert, aber das sorgt doch für einen gewissen Mehraufwand sowohl bei der Aufnahme als auch bei der Nachbearbeitung.Ich kann hier für diese Dinge auch nur insgesamt einen Stern abziehen. Denn jedes mal, wenn man das Objektiv in die Hand nimmt und auch dessen Abbildungsleistung sieht lässt sich das doch sehr verschmerzen. Für die Landschaftsfotografie ist es Abbildungstechnisch in diesem Brennweitenbereich wohl mit das Beste, was es an der Nikon D7100 und natürlich an vielen anderen Kameras momentan zu kaufen gibt, was auch gewisse Vergleichsseiten im Internet bestätigen. Ich sage hier deswegen explizit im Landschaftsbereich, weil die oben genannten Fehler (seitlicher Fehlfokus und Treffunsicherheit) nun alle nicht so tragisch sind. Sie dürften meiner Meinung nach nicht vorkommen, sind aber auch nicht tragisch.. Bei jedoch anderen Einsatzgebieten sähe das sicherlich anders aus. Des Weiteren möchte ich hier natürlich auch nicht pauschalisieren. Es gibt mit Sicherheit genug Leute, die diese Fehler nicht an ihrer Objektiv-Kamera-Kombination feststellen können. Bei mir war es jedoch so."
Amazon Kunde,,Tolles Objektiv / leider ohne Garantie,"Ein tolles Objektiv nach den ersten 3 Videos damit! Ich bin sehr begeistert und habe es für meine Canon 90d geholt um noch bessere Qualität herauszubekommen.Leider kann man das Objektiv nicht bei Sigma in Deutschland registrieren und hat somit keinerlei Garantie. Ich habe mich ebenfalls mit Sigma in Kontakt gesetzt die mir das nochmal bestätigt haben und so keine Garantie ansprechen konnten.. leider.Ich habe jetzt nochmal den Verkäufer hier um eine Garantie gebeten die mir ausgehändigt wird, da ich sonst das Objektiv in Deutschland kaufen würde und dieses zurück schicken will. Deshalb nur 4 Sterne weil es ein wenig komplizierter ist. Sollte sich das ändern und ich eine Garantie vom Verkäufer bekommen gebe ich gerne 5 Sterne da es super viel spass macht mit dem Objektiv zu arbeiten."
James,,Awesome lens!,"Brilliant lens! Super sharp even wide open and perfect for astrophotography despite being a little too long for astrophotography. It doesn't have any stabilisation, but that definitely isn't a deal breaker.Probably one of the best fast standard zooms sort of equivalent (in both focal length and DOF equivalent with crop factor taken into consideration).Build quality feels exceptional, rings are incredibly smooth, comes with a nice padded case and overall a brilliant lens.My only complaint would be the rubbish rear lens cap that comes with it - the one for the front element is fine, but I just used a spare canon one for the rear and it works much better.Absolutely recommended."
Julia Ha,,Perfektes Objektiv,"Ich bin trotz diesem Preis mit dem Objektiv äußerst zufrieden, ich wollte ein Objektiv mit dem man die Blende möglichst weit öffnen und gleichzeitig Zoomen kann. Beides ist bei diesem Objektiv optimal gegeben!! Bildqualität ist extrem gut!! Super schöne Hintergrundunschärfe mit Blende 1,8!!"
lara,,Messa a fuoco automatica fuori gioco,"Sarebbe l'obbiettivo perfetto 🤩per quel che volevo, ottimo dettaglio, ottima luminosità ecc ecc peccato che la messa fuoco automatica non funzionasse 😡 così lo riconsegnato e non ho osato provare a fare un secondo acquisto tanto è palese che è caratteristica di questo obbiettivo e che sigma non abbia ancora risolto...peccato veramente"
Miguel Francisco Gamez Lopez,,Mi lente favorito para sensores Aps-c,Uso este lente con mis a6000 y 6300. Utilizo el adaptador LA EA1. Me permite autofocus sin glitches ni problemas en modo fotográfico. En modo video no funciona muy bien. Asombrosamente nítido en f1.8. Perfecto para fotografía de calle con su distancia focal equivalente a un 22mm a 52mm. Mucho potencial para fotografía panorámica. Lo recomiendo muchísimo.
Giuseppe Nappo,,LA MIGLIORE OTTICA QUALITA' - PREZZO,"Senza parole!Era da tempo che nesentivo parlare benissimo e alla fine mi sono deciso e l'ho presa!Io la uso su Panasonic GH4 con adattatore Metabones Speedbooster ed è subito diventata l'ottica migliore in assoluto!Luminosa, Nitida e bei coloriLa messa a fuoco è veramente veloce e precisa MA SOPRATTUTTO SILENZIOSA!!Consigliato!Come al solito spedizione e imballaggio ottimi!"
Rak Andrhea,,MIGLIOR OBIETTIVO CHE POSSIEDO,"Questo obiettivo è semplicemente magnifico! L'apertura a 1.8 lo rende luminosissimo e veloce, questo piccolo zoom è un semi-dio, Sigma si conferma top class, anche nella solidità dei materiali. Gli obiettivo ART possono soffrire di fronte/back focus, ma è aggiustabile e un prezzo che vale la pena pagare per questa qualità!"
Cherokee44,,Tout le savoir faire de SIGMA,"Très belles qualités optiques pour ce Sigma Objectif 18-35 mm F1,8 DC HSM ART, bonne qualité de construction (on sent que c'est du solide, fait pour durer), l'ouverture à f1.8 est juste exceptionnelle, avec de superbes effets bokeh.Le seul petit défaut c'est son poids assez généreux de 810 g, couplé avec un boîtier reflex + grip batterie, on flirte avec les 1.5 kgs, rendant un peu compliqué les longues séries de photos à main levée (pied photo conseillé). Mais bon, cela vaut le coup pour cette objectif exceptionnel, mariant à la fois, un petit zoom léger et 3 focales fixes."
Toni,,"Super, mit kleinen Abstrichen!","Großartiges Objektiv. Keine Frage. Alles, was man so liest über die optischen Qualitäten und die Verarbeitung kann ich nur bestätigen. Es macht einfach Spaß, damit zu fotografieren. Ärgerlich ist, das Sigma auch bei diesem Objektiv Probleme mit der Fokussierung hat, was die äußeren Fokusfelder an Nikonkameras betrifft. Dieses Phänomen habe ich an meiner D7100 auch schon mit den Sigma 30mm f/1,4 gehabt und hier das Gleiche. Die seitlichen Fokusfelder sind nicht nutzbar, was schon sehr ärgerlich ist. Sigma streitet übrigens ab, dass es am Objektiv liegt, weil das ja nur passiv am Fokusiervorgang beteiligt ist. Andere Objektive funktionieren jedoch einwandfrei an der Kamera, so dass ich ein Problem der Kamera selbst weitgehend ausschließen kann.Ich habe das Objektiv trotzdem behalten ih der Hoffnung, dass es irgendwann eine Justierungsmöglichkeit seitens Sigma gibt. Die optische Qualität und auch die Verarbeitung des Objektivs sind jedenfalls unschlagbar. Mit dem Gewicht muss man allerdings klarkommen, das sei hier auch noch erwähnt, aber keinesfalls als Kritik."
Cliente Amazon,,"Obiettivo sigma 18-35, favoloso a dir poco!!","Obiettivo fantastico da tutti i punti di vista. Materiale di alta qualità, sia al tatto che da un punto di vista visivo. In merito alla qualità dell'immagine sono rimasto impressionato, sia per la sua nitidezza che la sua luminosità. Sul mio corpo macchina ( nikon d 5100) non ho avuto nessun problema di messa a fuoco con Af ( avevo letto sui vari forum che esisteva questo problema, che in realtà é facilmente risolvibile con l'accessorio apposito da connettere al computer via usb). A questo prezzo penso che non si possa trovare obiettivo migliore.Consigliatissimo al 100%"
Jonathan Maman,,Amazing for the price,"Amazing for the price. As an amateur who's been getting into photography for a few years it really stepped up my game. I wouldn't recommend this lens to an amateur just starting out because there is a learning curve and in some respects its not very forgiving. On the other hand, if you know what you're doing you'll have a lot of fun."
Davide T.,,Qualità ART,Acquistata perchè ero curioso di provare la serie ART e devo dire che sono rimasto sbalordito in senso positivo!E' ottima sotto tutti i punti di vista e ha la stessa qualità di un fisso. Provata in molte circostanze e non mi ha mai deluso. Peccato solo per il peso ma la qualità è davvero eccellente. Rimane la miglior lente che abbia mai avuto per APS-C.Super!
igor a.,,Problema de foco,El producto me llego y cuando enfocaba bien se veia perfecto.pero tenia problemas con el foco en algunos puntos sobre todo en infinito... Supuestsmente se puede solicionar con el dock pero siendo un objetivo tan caro tendria que venir perfecto
LukasFilmmaker,,Best S35 lens!,"It’s the best lens for the price and delivers an astoundingly image.Pros:+ sharp even when shooting at low stops like 1.8+ fast down to f1.8+ big manual focus ring which allows an easier follow focus setup+ stop and focus indicator right on the lensCons:- not full frame but that’s okay for me personally because I prefer to shoot S35 anyways- heavyAll in all it’s a perfect lens, that can be used for video as well as photography. It is one of the best in the whole industry, when it comes to photo and video lenses under 1000$/€"
Anonymous User,,Amazing!,Amazing quality. I wish it had a larger focal range but getting 1.8 throughout provides such flexibility it really is amazing. It is quite bulky ... heavier than my actual camera body which is to be expected given the specs to be honest. On the other hand it feels like a rock and the zoom ring is very smooth.
Jose Ignacio,,A really amazing lens,"This Lens are awesome. I have also tried the Sigma 17-55 f2.8 and I was not sastify at all with the sharpness overall the photos (in fact my kit lens is sharper), so I sent it back to Amazon. After reading a lot of reviews I decided to try with this one, I just can say that it is awesome in all the zooms and apertures, it is sharp like a Katana!! I can not say that it is a general porpouse zoom, but in my case I shot mainly in this range since I use to make street photography and architecture photo. Also I have the Canon 50mm f1.8 in case of more zoom is needed. I haven't any front-back focus problems but I have to make more tests with it, I have bought also the Sigma Dock and I have to check the fine tuning features that you can do with it. I have had some focus problems, but I guess that the problem it is which type of AF point you select, if you use the cross type focus ones it doesn't fail at all. Also using Live view focusing mode I haven't had any problem, buy be aware about this autofocus problems because they're common in all the reviews I have read. The construction is solid and high quality, not environmental sealed but you have what you have paid for ( this Lens if it were existed in Canon L series you will pay the double). The colours and tonal contrast is also really good. I just can say this lens is a must for APS-C users."
Nestor Barrera,,Increíble! El mejor angular de todos!,"Increíble lente! Muy útil! Lo compre y es el que uso diario un 80% de las veces, tiene incluso bien marco! El bokhe es increíble! Súper nítido! Lo recomiendo al 100! Vale cada centavo pagado por el!"
Miguel Angel,,Calidad impresionante,"Calidad de imagen y constructiva impresionantes. Con su apertura máxima de 1.8, es posible tomar fotos en condiciones de poca luz sin aumentar demasiado el ISO. En las fotografías tomadas sobre trípode, la nitidez es sencillamente fabulosa.Como único pero, su rango focal es muy corto, pero eso ya lo tenía asumido y prefería la calidad por encima de la versatilidad."
RichLogic,,Exceeded expectations,Exceeded expectations. People talk about the auto-focus issues but the lens has to be calibrated to your unique camera. It's a must. Do that and all those focus complaints vanish. You can try to do it yourself but I wouldn't bother. Just pay to have your local camera shop do it for you. Absolutely amazing lens.
Christin W.,,Soooo scharf!,"Gestochen scharf, super schnell, wunderschöne Fotos! Ich benutze das Objektiv an der Nikon D500 und LIEBE es. Am Anfang war der Fokus Punkt ca. 1mm unterhalb des gewährten Punktes. Witzigerweise ist es nun aber punktgenau. Vielleicht hatte ich auch einfach was falsch gemacht. Jedenfalls ist es super!"
Nicholas,,Il miglior obiettivo per APS-C,"Miglior obiettivo in assoluto per APS-C. Utilizzo sia su Canon 650D sia su Samsung NX1 con adattatore.Super nitido anche 1.8 . E' eccezionale per i video, sfocato paragonabile al 50mm 1.4 di canon. I due ring dello zoom e del fuoco sono molto fluidi e permettono di creare cambi di fuoco eccezionali.CONSIGLIATISSIMO"
Luca Angioli,,La lente perfetta,"Arrivato ieri... che dire è in ottica che praticamente copre il range di tre fisse con un apertura introvabile si qualunque altro zoom. Su bmpcc 4K con metabones arriva a 1.2, luminosissima a low light, perfetta per il video!"
Marco1227,,Il miglior zoom mai prodotto,"Cosa dire di piu', nitido come pochi prime a 1.8, produce immagini ricche di contrasto.Qualita' costruttiva straordinaria, l'autofocus e' un po incostante ma solo a 1.8 dove richiede (ovviamente) grande precisione.Una lente che rende giustizia alla mia D7200. Una volta montata, non vorrete piu' toglierla.Se avete un apparecchio APS-C (DX) non potete non acquistarla. Se fate video, ancora di piu'.Caldamente consigliata."
davipadi,,Servizio Amazon perfetto. Prodotto fantastico.,"Sulla lente c'è poco da dire, è una delle più famose uscite negli ultimi anni. Se fosse compatibile anche con full frame sarebbe l'obiettivo perfetto, ma probabilmente costerebbe il triplo del suo prezzo attuale. Il servizio di Amazon, come al solito, è stato celere, consegnando il pacco in perfette condizioni il giorno dopo."
Nate,,Amazing lens for portraits with only minor draw-backs,"I love this lens. The photos are super sharp, although just a tad soft in corners at f/1.8 but nothing too bad. As I use this as a portrait lens, it doesn't matter if the corners are a bit soft plus I rarely shoot portraits at f/1.8 anyways.... at f/2.8 the full picture is really sharp, so this becomes a moot point.There is barely any vignetting at 18mm and distortion is really minor across the 18-35mm range.The bokeh this thing produces is amazing. The aperture blades produce some beautiful round bokeh bubbles from background light.Focus is really fast and accurate on my 800D, although in some indoor shooting scenarios recently, there were some rare occasions where AF couldn't find focus at all. My EFS 15-85mm, however, had no issues finding focus. As a work around, I enabled flash (but disabling firing). This provided the contrast needed to get a focus lock.Four small issues:1) It is heavy2) The MF/AF switch feels cheap and clunky3) The barrel is so long that the on camera flash is not really usable in most scenario (barrel casts a shadow).4) For the price and weight, you'd expect OIS.Still a definite buy from me though."
⚯͛ RB 9¾,,Un Objectif juste dingue! Le Sigma 18-35 1.8,"J’ai acheté cet objectif dans le but de faire des photos de ciel étoilé.Pour le prix, je ne m’attendais pas à un résultat aussi impressionnant. Le piqué de cet objectif, sa luminosité ainsi que son ouverture rendent chaque photo incroyable !Même de jour, les photos sont saisissantes.Les matériaux utilisés sont de qualité, et laisse paraître un objectif assez résistant.Son seul défaut pourrait être le poids, mais le résultat en vaut la peine.Malgré son faible zoom, il reste un objectif grand angle très polyvalent. Il n’est pas destiné à la macro, et il peut quand même prendre des photos de très près sans soucis.Si vous cherchez à prendre des photos dans des environnements sombres, ou avec du bokeh, et si vous aimez les photos avec du détail, alors n’hésitez pas !"
Beuteid,,Sehr gut,Ich habe das Objektiv mit meiner Nikon D7000 zum Fotografieren von Polarlichtern erstmals eingesetzt. Klasse Ergebnisse. Sehr lichtstark und man erzielt schon mit Belichtungszeiten von 1-2 Sekunden herausragende Fotos.
jvillain,,Love it.,There are a million in depth reviews of this lens on the various photography sites and every thing they say is true. If you shoot APS-C this is a very nice piece of glass at a really decent price considering the competition. After shooting on this for a month I've added this 50-100 to my wishlist. I wish Canon had the same respect for their DSLR APS-C customers that Sigma has shown.
Rainhard Wiesinger,,Leider gelegentliche Probleme mit Fokus,"Warren nicht die gelegentlichen Probleme mit Back- und Frontfokus würde das Objektiv 5 Sterne verdienen.

Lalit,,Good lens but a bit heavy,The lens is a bit heavy. Its quite sharp though u do need to tweak it with the sigma pod. The bokeh is not that good. But that i guess is to expected with a max zoom of 35mm.
paul,,could be very sharp if well calibrated,"could be a sharp Lens. The problem is that it front / back focuses. So if I want to make it work properly, I have to buy the usb dock, wich adds a lot to the initial price.EDIT : I bought the usb dock and couldn't calibrate it correctly even after spending more than 5/6 hours. The autofocus isn't accurateI send it back to Sigma very disapointed"
Gerardo del Valle,,"The product is excellent, sharper than prime lenses","The product is excellent, sharper than prime lenses. The only downside is that you need to be aware that if you buy it from most of the sellers in Amazon it does not include the 7 years Canadian warranty."
Alexander Oppitz,,Beste Option für D7100,"Ich habe viele Objektive in verschiedenen Preiskategorien für die D7100 (Nikon) getestet.Mit das Beste in der Abbildungsschärfe was ich in den Händen hatte, vor Allem in Kombination mit Fokal und dem USB-Doc - hiermit lässt sich das Objektiv zu Hause (mit nicht zu unterschätzendem Aufwand) feinjustieren, das Ergebnis überzeugt durch die Bank."
C. Economides,,"No autofocus issues with D7200, razor sharp images.","I never write reviews, but I was very hesitant to get this lens due to all the reported issues with autofocus, so I wanted to let other people on the fence about this lens my experience so far. I am using it with a NIKON D7200 and out of the box I can confidently say I don't have any issues with autofocus so far. No missed pictures, no other issues using AF-S or AF-C with center autofocus point."
Cliente Amazon,,Tal vez el mejor objetivo del mercado,"Objetivo excelente en cuanto calidad precio, justo lo que necesitaba para hacer muchas de las fotos que yo hago, que son en interiores pequeños."
Alfredo,,Ottica favolosa,La possedevo già con attacco Nikon ed è stata un ulteriore conferma. Sigma in questi ultimi anni ha cambiato marcia e sta creando prodotti veramente di elevata qualità... niente da invidiare alle ottiche dei produttori proprietari ad un prezzo decisamente interessante.
SheepFactory,,... video and the image quality of the lens is amazing. If you are buying this for a smaller ...,I got this yesterday for video and the image quality of the lens is amazing. If you are buying this for a smaller dslr/mirrorless camera for video be aware that the lens is VERY heavy. It is pretty much impossible to run and gun with this lens handheld. Just a headsup to anyone thinking of getting it for that. You will need to shoot on a tripod or with a shoulder rig.

Jon Uyuni,,Jon,"Excelente. Usado con black magic 2,5k. Indispensable al tener el factor de recorte de 2,2x lo que da una distancia de 40-75mmUna definicion increible y gran calidad de materiales. La serie art de sigma es muy muy buena."
Emmanuele Esposito,,Straordinario,Vale 6 stelle per la nitidezza e la qualità già ad ff1.8 è un'obiettivo straordinario altamente consigliato non vi deluderà se vi occorre luminosità a fronte di un escursione meno versatile del classico zoom. Paragonato a 17-55 2.8 Canon non c'è paragone sigma ha fatto un lavoro eccezionale
Cliente Amazon,,OBBIETTIVO FAVOLOSO,"Lo uso su una Gh5, con un adattatore... fa delle foto spettacolari, e usandolo anche nel video... non è niente male, risponde in maniera ottimale alle varie impostazioni senza problemi!"
Mustafa,,Great lens,"I was using the kit lens 18-55 with my nikon d5600. After changing to this one, I realized that I was wasting my time with the existing kit lens. Now, I am using my tokina(11-16) for lanscape photography and sigma 18-35 for portrait photography and as a walk-around lens. It is a must-have for a DX camera."
Janina De,,Sehr Gut,"Ein tolles Objektiv für Sport und Indoor Fotografie. Die Brewnnweite ist für meine Zwecke in limitierten Räumen ideal geeignet sowohl für Produkt Fotografie, Sport und Portraits. Es liegt gut in der hand und ist solide verarbeitet."
Maik Heyl,,Super Objektiv,"Anfangs war ich skeptisch, jetzt ist es mein absolutes Lieblingsobjektiv. Eine tolle Schärfe wie von Festbrennweiten. Die Lichtstärke mit 1.8 ist eh sehr gut und die Verarbeitung klasse. Einzig der AF könnte schneller sein, daher nicht für Sportfotografie geeignet."
AM,,"Gute Lichtstärke, aber nur durchschnittliche Bildqualität.","Gute Lichtstärke, aber Bildqualität nur durchschnittlich; da viele andere Rezensenten wahre Lobeshymnen auf das Objektiv sangen, kann es sein, dass ich ein Montags-Exemplar erwischt habe. Ging wegen mangelnder Bildschärfe (und das bei dem Preis) zurück."
Amazon Customer,,SHE IS IN LOVE,"She loves the depth of field, colour, warmth....would buy it again any day and highly recommends it ...."
Client d'Amazon,,Juste parfait,"C'est le 2ème objectif Sigma que j'achète après le 135mm f 1.8.Utilisé lors d'un shooting en extérieur, j'étais surpris de voir que la mise au point était réussie sur 100% des photos prises même à pleine ouverture.C'est l'objectif le plus nette que j'ai utilisé jusqu'ici.Avec un taux de distorsion faible, il convient parfaitement pour des photos de mode et à 35mm (56 mm sur APS-C Canon) il est parfait pour du portrait.L'objectif est assez imposant et lourd mais cela ne me pose aucun problème.Vraiment satisfait de mon achat. La gamme Art de shez Sigma est vraiment une excellente alternative aux objectifs Canon un peu onéreuses."
JorgeHI100,,Una obra de arte para hacer obras de arte,"Un grandisimo objetivo, merece la pena cada euro. Gran calidad, nitido, buen enfoque, robusto, enfoque suave para vídeo y cine y muy luminoso. Lo lo quito de la cámara. Eso si, pesa."
Snowy,,Solid metal lens and it’s made in  Japan,Such a nice lens and fast reaction. The whole lens is solid aluminum. It’s a real made in Japan.
Emmerich Gradwohl,,"mein ""immerdrauf"" Objektiv","Die Optik ist einfach super. Eine durchgängige Lichtstärke von 18 bis 35 mm leistet mir wirklich gute Dienste.Den überschwänglich positiven Beschreibungen in etwaigen Foren war ich etwas skeptisch aber der Test hat bestätigt das sie eine wirklich gute Optik mit hohen qualitativen Eigenschaften ist.Bei diesem Objektiv sind die Vorzüge zu Lasten der Größe und des Gewichtes gegangen, das ist der einzige Punkt mit dem sich der Anwender anfreunden muss. Sonst eine klare Empfehlung."
Michael Kainz,,Super scharf,"Großartiges Objektiv. Ich verwende es auf einer Ursa mini Pro 4,6k und auf einer Nikon 5500. Auf beiden Geräten liefert es superscharfe Bilder!! Ich bin begeistert und werde das nächste Zoom der Art Serie von Sigma bald erwerben!"
P.H.,,Top Objektiv!,"Glücklicherweise habe ich mich bei der Frage neue Kamera - ich nutze eine Nikon D 5200 - oder neues Objektiv für diese neue Objektiv entschieden! Damit gelingen sehr scharfe, klare Bilder. Bemerkenswerte Auflösung. Keinerlei Probleme gabs beim Autofocus. Von meiner Seite klare Kaufempfehlung."
Pouettt,,Très très bon,"Acheté pour un D7100 après avoir vu son test sur le site dxomark.com, le plaçant comme une très bonne alternative à plusieurs focales fixes.Qualité optique quasiment parfaite, à toutes les focales et ouvertures. Pour ma part j'ai observé un problème de MAP à pleine ouverture sur toutes les focales. Ce problème peut être réglé soit via le réglage précis de l'auto focus disponible dans le boitier, soit via le dock Sigma.La qualité de construction est vraiment très bonne, l'objectif respire la solidité.Le penchant négatif de cette qualité est le poids de la bête... Ses 0.8 Kg se font sentir en fin de journée !En bref un très bon achat !"
Jorge Rey Azabal,,objetivo espectacular,"muy contento, de lo mejorcito en angular para apsc. volvería comprar sin duda."
Jessica Omaña,,Es un must,"En lente super versatil, super sharp, de excelente calidad y definitivamente muy importante de tener."
Cliente Amazon,,Top,"In seguito ad un ritardo del corriere non imputabile al fornitore, l’obiettivo è stato recapitato in perfette condizioni munito di tutti gli elementi, quali garanzie, foglio illustrativo e paraluce.👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"
D G,,Pb de netteté,Cet objectif (SN 53112393) comporte un défaut de netteté important sur les parties inférieures gauche des photos à différentes focales et ouvertures. Difficile d'imaginer un tel problème car la gamme ART Sigma Japan comporte un contrôle qualité assez poussé. Pas de problème de back Focus sur mon Nikon 7100. Je vais continuer à utiliser mon objectif Nikon 17-55 dont l'alignement des lentilles vient d'être repris . L'objectif Sigma a été renvoyé.
Eduardo C.,,"Perfecto, pero pesado.","La calidad es increíble, la construcción es muy sólida, es un diseño lindo, lo único negativo que podría decir no es una queja, sino algo que creo propio de un lente como este, y es que pesa mucho."
Jimy,,L'excellence incarnée,"Beau, robuste, bien construit et bien fini, cet objectif fait parti de l'excellence!Objectif série ART, il fait des merveilles tant bien en photo qu'en vidéo.Ses performances ne sont plus à démontrer et pour ma part, son seul est unique défaut est sa non stabilisation.Je peux vous assurer d'une chose, c'est qu'avec ce Sigma 18-35mm F1.8, vous franchirez un gap!Je recommande x10."
Marco,,Perfetto per apsc,"Nitidissimo e molto luminoso, unico neo le dimensioni ed il peso ma visti i risultati ne vale la pena. Quasi un tutto fare"
iand,,But great picture quality,Beautifil quality. Heavy glass. But great picture quality. Low light performance at low apperetures is great. All in all a very good quality lens for portrait and landscape.
Javid Ali,,Great lens but NOT for full-frame,"It's a really good lens, but not good for full frame camera. On full frame you get like 40-65mm instead of 18-35, by using only the middle portion of the full frame sensor. So I returned it and bought a full-frame lens."
José javier,,La calidad de imagen,"Lo que he probado es una pasada, pero tendré que probarlo más a fondo, de momento súper bien"
Luciano,,"grande ottica, ma autofocus non funziona","Desideravo quest'ottica per il suo rapporto d'apertura , al primo posto nella sua classe . Ha un grave Handicap per l'autofocus, che su Canon Eos EF va in tilt e non raggiunge la posizione bloccando la camera."
JD,,Objetivo perfecto,"En mi caso, no puedo decir nada malo sobre el, todo lo contrario, es perfecto.recordad: solo para apsc, para full frame no sirve"
DoroT,,einfach nur top!!!!,Ich habe dieses Objektiv nun seit einigen Monaten im Einsatz und ich bin begeistert. Schärfe und Bildqualität sind mit den Standard-Kit Objektiven nicht zu vergleichen. Die Investition lohnt sich auf jeden Fall.
Julian Dreher,,Top Objektiv!!,Ich benutze das Objektiv an meiner Panasonic Lumix Gh5 mit einem Viltrox Adapter. Zum Rand hin merkt man bei 18mm eine deutliche Vignettierung. Ansonsten ist es ein mega Objektiv was definitiv seinen Preis wert ist.
Javivigeo,,Javier,"Es maravilloso y muy nítido. Lo único malo es el tamaño y el peso, pero compensa. Yo lo utilizo con nikon d7100."
michele,,Spettacolare,"Obiettivo dalle caratteristiche eccezionali.Montato sulla mia Nikon D7200 da il massimo della performance.Non ho avuto la necessità di regolare la messa a fuoco perchè non perde un colpo in qualsiasi apertura.Lente luminosissima, nessuna aberrazione, robustezza e qualità dei materiali eccellenti."
Kevin K,,"Fantastic Lens, I have not had any issues with ...","Fantastic Lens, I have not had any issues with it at all. Great image quality and low light performance. Lots of reviews on this lens on YouTube. If you don't believe me, check them out."
Hugo,,Excelente objetivo!,"Me encantó éste objetivo, la nitidez que tiene y su precio, está algo pesado pero al final me resulta cómodo ya que lo uso principalmente en video."
paolo,,Ottimo,"Obiettivo davvero nitido,colori perfetti.....all'inizio avevo qualche dubbio su sigma ma la serie art e' davvero ottima"
Cliente Amazon,,ottimo obiettivo,"La qualità costruttiva dell' obiettivo è notevole, quella delle foto si raggiunge solo dopo un po' che ci si abitua al comportamento non sempre ripetibile dell' autofocus. Comunque, con questo obiettivo si riescono a fare foto che non hanno nulla da invidiare ad altre fatte con full frame."
Mauco,,Excelente,"Lente para toda ocasión, funciona para retrato, Ciudad, paisajes, diseñado para APS-C, muy buena calidad, muy buen diseño, rápido enfoque, bajo ruido. Definitivamente una buena compra"
ajay dewan,,This lens has been so useful for me to take videos under poor light conditions ...,"What a buy, I am proud of my purchase. This lens has been so useful for me to take videos under poor light conditions on my SLR"
Paz García García,,Optimo,Me encanta su luminosidad. Volvería a comprarlo. Tube un problema con mi tarjeta y Amazon fue muy comprensiva en la ayuda para solucionarlo. Todo genial.
Sameer bajaj,,Sigma,Very good products I’ve used a photo from this lens. It is completely worth it and awesome.
Mango,,"Toll, aber schwer","Lang, schwer, aber eine tolle Bildqualität. Für Portraits, die mit kleiner Brennweite aufgenommen werden müssen sehr geeignet. Auch Sterne konnte ich damit gut abbilden."
ConnieInAlberta,,Super nice,Well made lens with great clarity and apeture at 1.8
Brian Vickers,,Top!!,"I'm very happy, it is exactly what I wanted"
Stefan R.,,Mi opinion,"Lo compre como nuevo reaco por 455€ y llego como nuevo la verdad. La unica pega que tengo es el enfoque, aveces no hay manera que lo haga."
Arturo C Mora ,,Perfecto,Excelente producto y una atención inmejorable por parte del vendedor a través de Amazon. Realmente muy satisfecho con esta compra!
Francisco,,Excelente,"Por el momento estoy muy contento. Todas las reseñas que he leido y visto lo ponen muy bien. Muy buena construcción y suavidad por todos los costados. Ni que hablar la comodidad que significa tener un lente de cierta calidad y con un f1.8 de apertura fija mínima en todo el zoom. He leído que para vídeo no es gran cosa, pero por el momento con mis pruebas me ha dado resultado, hay que tomarle la mano."
MP,,Ist sein Geld Wert.,"Dieses sehr gute Objektiev ist sein Geld Wert.Es hat eine sehr gute Abbildungsleistung, schneller Autofokus und KEINE Probleme nit dem Fokuspunkt wie den Medien zu entnehmen ist."
Amazon Kunde,,Cinematisch,"Eines der besten Objektive in meinen Augen. Wer cinematisch filmen möchte, ist hier bestens bedient."
Meenulian,,Good product,Bought it for my husband for professional use. Very satisfied and happy with the product though the price is on higher side.
Achim Birkenhauer,,Super Objektiv,"Ich nutze es fast ausschließlich für Personen Aufnahmen bei schlechten Lichtverhältnissen. Mit dee durchgängigen Blende von 1,8 einfach Perfekt"
Hitiura ROYOL,,Très bon investissement !,"Waow :* Excellent objectif, hyper sharp , autofocus au point (pas ultra rapide mais vitesse satisfaisante), AF vraiment très silencieux ! Un must aussi bien pour la photo que la vidéo !Perso, testé sur 600d, 80d, Gh5 (avec speedbooster), sony a6400 (avec sigma mc-11)."

Dr. A Chatterjee.,,Excellent product. value for money.,"Very useful product. Built quality is good, excellent optics."
Roberto,,Spettacolare.,"Dal momento che l'ho montato sulla mia Nikon D7100 non l'ho più tolto.Obiettivo che da grandi soddisfazioni!!!Un consiglio, usatelo in manuale perché tira fuori il meglio di se."
blubbblubb,,Super Objektiv,Leider hat Sigma bekanntermaßen eine große Serienstreuung. Auch mein Objektiv musste eingeschickt werden um justiert zu werden (kostenlos). Seit dem macht das Ding aber super Bilder. Die Schärfe ist beeindruckend und der Brennweiten-Bereich ist super für den Alltag.
Arturo G.,,OBJETIVO,FUNCIONA CASI PERFECTO
Francesco M.,,Veloce ed affidabile,"Ottimo prodotto, funziona benissimo col mio Metabones EF > Sony full frame per A7R II (giro a super35), affidabile e veloce ;)"
Roberto Di Lonardo,,Buono ma con qualche neo,"Lente ottima, nitidezza ai massimi livelli, aberrazioni nulle. Il peso e le dimensioni sono abbastanza importanti. Unico neo l'AF che spesso è impreciso ma credo si possa risolvere tutto con il dock."
Cliente de Amazon,,UNA JOYA,"Un lente increíble, una joya indispensable. La calidad es la que sigma nos tiene acostumbrados en la línea Art, un belleza. Lo recomiendo"
Rogan,,très bon objectif,"Je mets 5 étoiles car j'ai pu sortir mon soucis de front focus avec l'usb dock de sigma.c'est tout simplement un très bon objectif, je regrette juste un peu qu'il soit pas stabilisé donc il rentre un peu en competition avec mon canon 17-55 f2.8.Si je sais que je vais filmer ou que je vais devoir être assez versatile (55mm + stabilisation), je prends le canon, si c'est tout de jour ou avec pied ou flash alors c'est le sigma.La grande ouverture aide beaucoup pour les beaux flou.Il m'a fait acheté le 50-100 f1.8 de Sigma que je considère comme ma meilleure optique, celui la prend des portraits de malades."
J&C&M,,GH5 + sigma 18-35: quelle déception!!!,"Par quoi commencer? Oui c’est vrai que le piqué est très bon (à partir de f2) et que sa grande ouverture (1.2 avec le viltrox EF M2) est un vrai plus en basse luminosité pour les appareils type GH5.Mais alors que d’inconvénients! L’objectif est lourd, trop lourd, pas de stabilisation mais surtout un autofocus inutilisable et extrêmement bruyant!!Et même la mise au point manuelle est une vraie galère avec comme beaucoup des problèmes de back-focus!J’attendais bcp de cet objectif mais je retourner le tout!"
Carlos Salazar,,Recomendable,"Excelente lente, bastante nítido. Quizá se queda un poco corto en cuanto a zoom pero para fines de arquitectura es excelente"
Abelardo Gallegos,,Para el diario,Se convirtió en mi lente de diario y está excelente
Cliente Amazon,,Perfetto!,"Ottimo ed in perfette condizioni, funzionante. Proprio ciò che mi serviva.Lavoro con una Sony Nex FS700 ed un Metabones SpeedBooster . Mi divertirò con questa lente!"

Aron,,Out of focus all the time,On my Nikon camera the focus is so bad. I have spent time to calibrate them but for nothing. I'm really disappointed by this lenses and unfortunately i can't see the hype around them.
Alfredo ,,la mejor que he probado,"Fantastico objevivo para APSC , sin duda es el mejor ."
tipode,,Une tuerie,"OK il est un peu lourd. Mais la qualité des images produites vous fait oublier ce ""détail"".C'est même embêtant de faire autant de si belles photos... Le tri n'en est que plus compliqué !"
Macky,,"Sigma 18-35mm F1,8 DC HSM","Ich bin mit dem Sigma 18-35mm F1,8 DC HSM sehr zufrieden. Sehr scharf, sogar bei Blende 1.8. Funktioniert mit meiner Nikon D7100 super. Klare Kaufempfehlung."
Alberto,,Una joya!!!,Espectacular la calidad de este objetivo en cuanto construcción y estética y que decir de la capacidad que tiene para conseguir unas imagenes nítidas y enfocadas.
Wes,,Good,Good
Silvia  M.,,No tan luminoso,"No es tan luminoso en comparación con un lente nikon, la apertura viene siendo un 3, pero por relación calidad - precio no está mal."

Alberto,,De los mejores objetivos sigma que se han hecho para cámaras APS-C,"Nitidez asombrosa, calidad,extraordinaria. Pesa? Sí pero no es para tanto, es un zoom angular 18-35 super luminoso, el enfoque va genial. Se puede acabar de perfilar con el Sigma Dock."

Jean-pierre B.,,Objectif remarquable !,"Une luminosité et aussi une qualité d'image exceptionnelles du niveau d'une très bonne focale fixe. Bien adapté pour les photos en intérieur.Non stabilisé par contre, mais mon boîtier est stabilisé (Pentax).Le poids et l'encombrement restent très acceptables pour de telles performances ."

Gosselin Benjamin,,Magique.,"Objectif impressionnant, la qualité optique à ce prix est excellente. Son defaut... son poids ! Sur un 80d on est vite surcharger.Aucun problème de back/front.En video il est top malgrés un autofocus bruillant (il faut un micro externe obligatoirement).Enfin je l'ai testé en astrophotographie et le resultat est magique ! À f1.8 avec cette qualité optique c'est du bonheur."
Kevin,,Enfoca super rápido,Es bastante grande pero no varia el tamaño cuando se da uso al zoom.
Rüdiger Schulz,,lichtstarkes Objektiv zum kleinen Preis,Ein super Objektiv. Gestochen scharfe Bilder. Der Autofocus ist etwas langsam. Das Gewicht ist nicht zu verachten. Aber Preis-Leistung für durchgängig f1.8 fegt die Bedenken einfach weg.

Schnapsit,,Welcome addition to my kit,"No surprises, its as large and weighty as I expected. However, its not IMHO an issue. The lens snaps to focus acceptably quickly and quietly. The quality of the results at this early stage are close to that of my next size up Canon L glass lens (which incidentally is close in size and weight too). On the whole, very pleased with sharpness, colour and distortion levels for a lens at this price. A capable wide with a f1.8 throughout its range."

増本　恵介,,APS-C最強の1本かも,F1.8通しのズームレンズ。ズーム幅こそ狭いものの、ちょっとした画角とかを簡単に変更できる。F値が変わらずに変更できる。値段は高いが、単焦点レンズを何本か買うと思えば安いもの。絞ればもちろんシグマらしい写真となる。そしてこのレンズを手に入れたことにより、３０ｍｍF1.4の存在価値がわかってくると思う。ただ、結構重い（笑）
Amazon カスタマー,,人物撮影には最適だが、ピント合わせに癖がある。,目的は主に屋内屋外での人物撮影。20mmと24mmと28mmと30mmの単焦点レンズのどれを買おうか迷っていたところ、このレンズを見かけたので購入。F値1.8は単焦点レンズの1.4には及ばないものの、単焦点レンズに肉薄していると言っていいと思います。APS-Cで30mmより広角でF値が明るいレンズとなると、非常に種類が限られます。20mmや24mmの単焦点もあることにはありますが、価格が高すぎる・・・そんなときにこのレンズが役に立つかなと思います。ただし、構造的にかなり無理をしているのか、AFがきっちり合うのは中央付近のみのようです。ピントを合わせたい部分が端に寄っている構図の場合、どうがんばってもAFが合いません・・・そのため、撮りたい構図はどうしても限られます。USBドックをやればどうにかなるのかな・・・？

Jake,,Amazing Lens!,"I was researching on this lens for several weeks - then I just went for it and bought it! And I'm so glad I made the jump. I've not used it that much at the moment - but from what I've experienced, it's amazing! It's razor sharp for a zoom! It's got some weight to it, too! As you may of heard. But it's not an issue at all. This lens completes my setup - so I'm pleased! You won't regret this purchase!"

Baudolino,,Ahora empiezo a entender las ofertas de Amazon...,"La peor compra que he hecho hasta ahora. El pasado mes de octubre compro este objetivo porque viene con una gran descuento por parte de Amazon. Una vez recibido, constato lo que la mayoría de usuarios que poseen esta lente, que tiene un problema de front focus acusadísimo.A regañadientes, porque me parece increíble que un objetivo de una supuesta gran calidad venga así, decido comprar el dock de Sigma para intentar calibrarlo. La calibración a 0,28m, 0,35m y 0,50m no queda mal; el problema es que... ¿cuántas fotos suelen hacerse a esa distancia? La calibración a 2m es imposible. El objetivo enfoca a lo que quiere cuando quiere. Es anarquía pura. En trípode y con el focus test a la misma distancia siempre no acierta ni una. Lo intento con todas las variantes posibles (distancia focal, tipos de disparo, etc.) y cada vez peor. No hay por donde cogerlo.Decido devolver el objetivo a Amazon. El objetivo está agotado ya (no hay ni a ese precio ni a otro). Pasados unos días, de repente hay uno en stock. Contacto con atención al cliente y es posible el reemplazo. Creo que ya voy a poder tener el objetivo del que tantas buenas opiniones he leído. Me lo envían, lo abro y todo se viene abajo. El objetivo tiene claros signos de uso y polvo en el frontal de la lente. No me lo puedo creer. Por curiosidad pruebo a ver qué tal y... ¡sorpresa! ¡problemas de front focus! Aunque me cuesta un poco menos que el anterior, lo calibro y, de nuevo, sobre un trípode y apuntado a una plantilla para foco, a veces marca que está a 2m y otras veces entre 0,5m y 2m. Perdido del todo. A veces todo nítido, a veces todo borroso. ¡En la misma posición y sin tocar nada!Lo dejo lo mejor que puedo y cuando paso a hacer pruebas reales, te das cuenta de lo que pasa, de dos metros en adelante que el objetivo no es capaz de saber a qué está enfocando y solo una de cada diez fotos sale nítida.En ese momento lo tengo claro: fraude de Sigma y fraude de Amazon. Fraude de Sigma por fabricar un objetivo que no es capaz de dar una con el foco y por no precintar sus productos para saber si están usados o no. Doble fraude de Amazon porque venden un artículo muy por debajo de su precio usual de mercado a sabiendas de lo que hay y cuando solicitas el reemplazo te envían uno usado que muy probablemente ha sido devuelto por la misma razón."

gary h,,How good good is this lens it's fantastic,I purchased this lens for landscape photography. How good good is this lens it's fantastic. Mine is a Pentax fit I use it on a k3.It's super sharp guide quality is fantastic. The only thing wrong with the lens is it's not weather sealed. Come on sigma make it weather sealed. I would say canon and Nikon uses would moan because of no image stabilization. Hey do wot I did sold all my Canon gear And went over to Pentax.The Pentax k3 has built in stabilization in body.So with the sigma 18-35mm the picture quality is fantastic.
KP,,best lens so far for crop sensor,"super fast, and quick focusing. min focusing distance not the greatest. but still an amazing lens. super solid construction, all metal. smooth focusing ring for video too. comes in a padded case as all sigma lens."

James,,Amzing replacement for a range of primes - ESSENTIAL for cropped sensor users!,Absolutely gorgeous lens that really does live up to the hype - it's pretty much a replacement for a variety of prime lenses with a quick autofocus and top notch build quality. If you have a cropped sensor then don't hesitate to buy this!My model had the issue of being slightly out of focus when using the autofocus but that was just the model delivered to me - I haven't heard anyone else make that complaint so it clearly isn't a wider issue.

Bei 18mm super für Milchstraßenbilder, bei 35mm super für Portraits!!-> klare Kaufempfehlung"
bubobubo,,CHECK YOUR LENS VERY CAREFULLY!!,"As you all can see the other reviews for this lens are outstanding. That as may be but when Sigma allow a £600 lens through their quality control with a glaring and obvious flaw you will understand why I have given it 1 Star. I was NOT impressed on my initial trials and took it out to some fields near by. I set it on 18mm and then noticed when looking through my view finder there was a dark blemish in the bottom left and top right corner of the lens as you can see in my attached photo I checked my camera with another wide angle lens and it was fine.The flaw disappeared as I increased magnification, so make sure you check this lens out on a bright landscape at 18mm just in case you have a lens with a similar flaw. I really don't know what is happening and wondered if the lens was seeing some of the lens hood. I have let Sigma know and trust they will get the stock checked properly before letting items like this be sold to the likes of you and me. Really NOT good enough!!!"
yug,,おおむね満足,画質は十分、重さは・・ぎりぎり許容範囲８０Dで使用した場合は、そのままではピント合ってませんでした。自分でピント調整しましたが、その後はピント良好です。α７R３を導入したらMC-11でクロップモードで使ってみる予定です。以下マウントアダプターでマイクロフォーサーズ機で使用するときの特徴。コントラストAFには向いていないのでしょう。静寂の中ではAFのたびにカタカタ音がして周りに聞こえる感じなので、音楽イベントの撮影では気を使いますが、静止画なら許容範囲動画時はピント固定で撮影する場合などで使いたいと思います。
M P Cook,,Faulty?,"Bought for a Canon 70D and focus was very hit and miss on anything over around 1 metre at f1.8. Just couldn't rely on it; when it focussed correctly it was stunning but that was perhaps 10-20% of the time. I've read up on the net and it appears this is a common problem - using liveview apparently helps but through the OVF it appears common. I sent it back and now can't decide whether to try another or go for the L series 17-40mm.I would think if you get a good one there's no better lens available, beautifully built and stunning images when it focusses."
Amazon Customer,,Did I get a dud?,"I don't know if I got a dud or not but I cannot get the lens to focus consistently and when it does focus, the image is still not sharp - in fact it is quite blurry.If my lens was indeed faulty then at this price point it just isn't acceptable - even much cheaper Canon lenses have better QC and produce sharper images (and auto focus works like a charm). It is also quite shocking when the lens is in fact ""Made in Japan"" - I thought it signified high quality, alas no longer the case!Not sure why this lens is so highly rated by others to be honest. I would have given it one star if it wasn't for its nice and solid build quality - the rings have just the right amount of feedback / resistance and you get the satisfaction that you are getting your money's worth (if it was working that is...).."
Tim Dennell,,Excellent quality lens - if 18-35mm suits your needs,"If you are reading this you probably are thinking of buying this lens. I've written this with you in mind. There are many reviews of this Sigma lens on the web, all rating it highly. Yes, this lens is a stellar performer.It's really comes down to two questions: whether this is the `right' focal length range for you? and do you really need 1.8 or would a 2.8 do? This 18-35mm 1.8 lens is made for crop sensor cameras; don't buy this for a full frame camera.18-35mm focal length might be too limiting for many. A Tamron 24-70mm 2.8 is about the same price and would make a more useful [hi-quality] workhorse lens (gets good reviews too). Sigma also do a 17-50mm 2.8. Nikon produce a 17-55mm f2.8 (look 2nd hand) that is said to be more useful on DX than 24-70mm - there are alternatives.If you're into wide angle, 18mm isn't what many consider true `wide angle'. Look at the 10-24mm range.The Sigma 18-35mm 1.8 is a very high quality lens - essentially a prime you can zoom between 18-35mm for framing (approx. 28-55mm full frame equivalent); being able to go as wide as 18mm (28mm fx) opens up many possibilities.I also own a Nikon 50mm f1.4, a Nikon 80-200mm f2.8 and a Nikon 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 lens.I found my Nikon 50mm limiting framing wise, as I guess other primes would be too in situations such as photographing in a workshop, an office, at an awards presentation with lots of seating etc. and shooting architecture at night where 'zooming with your feet' can be limited, or impossible.Portraits? Professional portrait photographers will be looking at a minimum of 50mm, 85mm, 105mm, 135mm etc.Street photography? Probably too big and obvious for many photographers; but for photographing large groups or individuals at awards ceremonies etc. this is the lens I'll reach for; results are acceptable.Low light often means having to use slower shutter speeds, which means thinking of using a tripod, or introducing flash.I have used this handheld on the street in near dark conditions, but you really do need very steady hands; focus wise you are better off focusing manually as AF will struggle. In low light (which can mean room lighting) I've found there is a point light-wise where it's better to focus manually than rely on AF - or start using flash.Being honest, it's rare you need to use f1.8. In day-light be prepared to stop this lens down to prevent images being overexposed. If doing landscapes, or daytime long exposures, you'll probably need a ND or ND grad filter. On the other hand 1.8 is useful in low light situations, if you really do need it...Lens flare control is excellent. You can shoot almost directly into the sun and flare is minimal - compared to other lenses (I leave the lens hood off).I often use this for long exposures at night; it gives great clarity and colour. It also gives good starbursts. For long exposures at night (30 seconds plus) I'm using f16 and an exposure compensation of -5 to stop the sensor being flooded by light. (I also shoot RAW and do post in Photoshop).Some reviews mention a miss-focusing issue. I've used my 18-35mm lens on a Nikon D90 and can't say I've noticed any focusing issues - certainly no more than with any other lens. When it nails focus it's very, very sharp; nice bokeh too...If, like me, you already have some good workhorse lenses - but need a good lens to go below the 50mm focal length, then this 18-35 costs less than several prime lenses (35mm, 30mm, 24mm etc.), and goes down to 18mm (dx) and gives stellar quality.Personally I'd be happier if this was, say, a 12-30mm lens (I love wide angle); for me this was a must have lens. I saved for a year to buy it and have no regrets.Downsides of this Sigma: it is big and heavy.You'll need a large carry case for a DSLR with this lens on; though this lens comes with quite a nice Sigma padded lens case for storage.If you buy from a dealer in a non EU country (I ordered mine from Japan via Amazon) bear in mind you will have to pay excise duties & VAT when it arrives in the UK. That added £140 onto my bill; I ended up paying the same as I would have had to had I bought from a UK retailer."
大学病院医師,,全焦点で開放でも四隅が崩れない,評判がよいので、星景用に購入しました。重いですが、1.8 開放で四隅まで星が点像です。広角域ではやや周辺減光がありますが2.8まで絞るとフラットになります。Sequatorというソフトと組み合わせることで、本当に赤道儀不要になります。
Elmar C.,,"Auch für Vollformat geeignet, ja Sie lesen richtig","Als das Objektiv auf den Markt kam, habe ich es für meine Nikon D7100 gekauft und war von Anfang an verliebt in die Kombination.Bei mir stimmt der Fokus 100%, glaube bei Nikon's funktionieren die irgendwie besser als bei Canon, so mein Eindruck, wenn man all die Rezensionen hier liest. Haptik ist zweifelsfrei TOP.Zu den Sachen gibt es aber hier schon genug geschrieben, ich widme mich daher mit einem ganz anderen Thema, kommen wir auf den Punkt.Bin jetzt auf Vollformat umgestiegen und glücklicher Besitzer der D750, welche ich auch noch hier in einer anderen Rezension bewerten werde.Bei der D750 gibt es die Möglichkeit, die Kamera auf Crop DX umzustellen (1,5), zudem aber auch noch auf DX mit Crop von 1,2.Genau hier spielt das Sigma 18-35 seine Rolle, bei diesem Crop lässt sich das Sigma ab Einstellung 22mm - 35mm verwenden, ab dieser Brennweite gibt es keine Randabschattungen mehr, das Bild ist voll ausgeleuchtet und das bei Offenblende wohl gemerkt. Aus den 1,8 werden bedingt durch den Crop, jetzt f:2,2. Immer noch ein Traumwert.Das beste ist, dass man bei dieser Einstellung immer noch satte 16MP hat.Das Objektiv ist jetzt ein 26-42mm f: 2,2. Mit der tollen Bildqualität der Vollformat.Das Bildrauschen ist einfach genial, selbst noch bei ISO 12800 wirklich brauchbar.Bin so froh, dass das Sigma jetzt mein Immerdrauf sein wird, für mich ganz klar Vollformattauglich. Wer etwas anderes behauptet, hat das selber noch nicht ausprobiert."
Nadja von Massow,,"Great lens, but stay away from 3rd party ""Used - Very Good"" offer","Great lens, especially for video. Fast, sharp and smooth focus.But here's a warning: stay away from Amazon's 3rd party ""Used - Very Good"" offer (fulfilled by Amazon) for £475.33 excl. VAT (£570.39 incl. VAT). I bought this item first and had to return it since it's not a Canon compatible lens. It only mounts onto Sigma's own cameras. I notified Amazon, but seems they didn't care and keep selling it under false product info, likely to disappoint more buyers."

Yoann B,,Un vrai petit bijou,"Détenteur d'un 700d de chez canon je souhaitais remplacer mon objectif de kit que je n'utilisais pas (18-55 mm). Possédant par ailleurs, comme bon nombre de personnes je pense, un 50mm f/1.8, je suis rapidement devenu accro de cet objectif ultra lumineux et je souhaitais retrouver les avantages liés à cette ouverture sur un ""trans-standard"" plus polyvalent qu'une focale fixe.Après avoir retourné le web pendant des semaines (voire plus), j'ai longtemps hésité entre celui-ci, et le tamron 17-50 f/2.8 (Canon 17-55 mm trop cher pour ce qu'il offre à mon goût). Au final, j'ai privilégié le piqué et l'ouverture à un objectif Ô combien meilleur marché, stabilisé et un peu plus polyvalent.Après une courte petite semaine, je ne le regrette absolument pas. dans les (+)- Piqué à tomber par terre- Autofocus ultra rapide. Bon il a qq fois mais très rarement je trouve un peu de mal mais 95% du temps il fait le taf, rien à voir avec le 50mm avec lequel je ne travaillais qu'en manuel...- Parfait pour prendre des photos de bambins branchés sur le 220v dans des conditions lumineuses pas top (lumineux + AF rapide = papa heureux), pour obtenir un joli bokeh qq soit la focale, pour les photos nocturnes (trépied indispensable bien sur), etc.- Remplace 3 focales fixes (+1 bonus) et correspond à mes besoins : portrait + photo loisirs vacances + photo ""artistique"", enfin pour moi :)- De mon côté, mes yeux pas trop bioniques n'ont pas détecté de problèmes de back ou front focus (corrigeable via le dock USB de chez sigma) apparemment monnaie courant avec l'objo... Je verrai plus tard si je réalise qq tests avec une réglette graduée.- Livré avec une housse et un pare-soleil, tout deux de très bonne qualitéDans les (-)- Il est lourd : sur un 700d tout léger par exemple, plus question de laisser pendouiller l'appareil autour du cou sans maintenir l'objectif. Par ailleurs, mon trépied de marque amazon ne supporte pas la charge, il pique du nez en avant, obligé de le bricoler un peu pour que ça tienne- Il est volumineux : Plus possible de faire tenir mon appareil + le 50 mm dans ma petite sacoche.- Il est cher : mais bon au regard de ses performances, tout est relatif....Au final je suis pour le moment totalement conquis mais je verrai à l'usage après plusieurs semaines et mois si j'ai vraiment fait le bon choix. Pour l'heure, je le conseille sans hésiter pour ceux qui recherchent un objectif de ce type. FON-CEZ! :)"
何でも勘でも,,５本分の単焦点レンズが１本に,シグママウントですが、シグマＭＣ－１１コンバータにてソニーＥマウントにてＡ７ＲIIIにて使用。カメラ側の設定をオートにしていますので実際はクロップしてしまいます。Ａ７ＲIIIの画素数が4200万画素あるのでＡ７IIIの2400万画素とほぼ同等になるので気にならないです。このレンズの特徴は約２倍ズームですがＦ値1.8の変化が無いのとインナーフォーカスレンズの為、全長が変化しない所にあり、単焦点レンズ１８㎜、20㎜、24㎜、28㎜、35㎜と５本のレンズを揃えなくても此れ１本で済ませるので便利なところにある気がします。
Amazon Kunde,,The holy grale of photography at a decent price,"Wonderful objective. The pictures are very sharp and you can take very artistical pictures with it. The only thing you have to take care with, is to stay very steady while taking a picture as it has no internal stabilisation.I definitely have no regrets about this objective, it was worth every cent."
A,,Excellent lens! Image quality is fantastic,"Excellent lens! Image quality is fantastic, on par or better than many good prime lenses I've tried, even more so for the price.Well built and easy to use, both dials are firm and have the right amount of travel and dampening to offer precision and stability. It's also very easy to operate with outdoors and/or at night, even with gloves.As for taking pictures of the night sky, it's also great: the zoom range gives flexibility for composition, the large aperture shortens exposure time (so no mandatory star trails :), and the image quality translates into pin sharp stars.Main downside for me is the size, but given the quality and unique flexibility this lens offers, I think it's very understandable."
Thorsten G.,,"Groß, Schwarz, Stark.","Zunächst einmal: Ich bin kein Profifotograf, sondern ein Hobbyfotograf mit gewissen Ansprüchen, der immer öfter die Kamera in die Hand nimmt um schöne Momente festzuhalten. Vor Jahren bin ich angefangen mit einer Nikon D5000, dann D5100 und jetzt eine D5300. Verwendet habe ich bisher die Kitobjektive, das Nikkor 35mm und das Sigma 17-70, mein bisher liebstes Objektiv, welches aber im WW-Bereich nicht ganz meinen Vorstellungen entsprach.Auf der Suche nach einem Lichtstarken und Abbildungsstarken Objektiv kam ich immer wieder auf dieses Sigma 18-35mm. Viele Tests gelesen, positiv und negativ, doch die Vorteile haben mich zum Kauf bewegt. Und ich habe es nicht bereut.Mein Sigma 17-70 hatte einen leichten Frontfokus, den ich aber mit dem USB-Dock beseitigen konnte. Darum machte ich mir auch keine großen Sorgen um F/B-Focus am 18-35. Natürlich habe ich das 18-35 gleich getestet und alles war perfekt. Selbst der AF, von einigen bemängelt, klappt bei mir einwandfrei. Vielleicht mag er an einer Profi Kamera schneller sein, aber ich bin sehr zufrieden. Jetzt, nach ca. 400 Bildern kann ich sagen, dass es für mich nicht besser sein könnte. Ich fotografiere gerne Architektur, Landschaften und Portraits. Spiele dabei gerne mit Licht, verwende aber ungern Blitz (den Systemblitz kann man bei diesem großen Objektiv gleich vergessen). Aufgrund der durchgehenden Lichtstärke von 1.8 ist es eine Wonne mit diesem Objektiv Indoor zu fotografieren. Das Spielen mit der Tiefenschärfe macht einfach nur Spaß. Portraits habe ich selbst mit dem Nikkor 35mm nicht so scharf bekommen, wie mit dem Sigma. Einige meiner „Objekte“ weigern sich ja schon Model zu stehen ;-), weil man wirklich kleinste Details Messerscharf sieht.Wie von anderen Rezensenten auch beschrieben, konnte ich CA’s bei einigen Bildern feststellen. Allerdings auch nur bei starker Vergrößerung der Bilder. Für mich daher kein Kritikpunkt. Die Schärfe nimmt bei Blende 1.8 am Rand minimal ab, aber ab Blende 2.8 habe ich bisher nichts Vergleichbares gesehen, Fantastisch!Auch wenn man sich an die Größe und das Gewicht gewöhnen muss, kommt mir so schnell kein anderes Objektiv an meine D5300. Mehr Brennweite habe ich bisher nicht vermisst, im Gegenteil.Das Sigma 18-35 macht einen überaus wertigen Eindruck und liefert ungeahnte Ergebnisse.Fazit: Sehr Empfehlenswert für Hobbyfotografen, als auch Profis."
Guillaume,,Mefiance sur cet achat par Amazon...Provenance ?,"Objectif excellent mais à ne pas acheter sur Amazon. Je m'explique ; produit reçu sans soucis ;c'est à l'heure du test que les problèmes se sont montrés. Énormes problèmes de back front focus, autofocus qui patine presque tout le temps, photos floues à presque toutes les focales et toutes les ouvertures. Bref j'ai clairement eu affaire à un produit défectueux et reconductionné et même un recalibrage d'usine par le dock Sigma n'y a rien changé.SINON l'objectif que j'ai acheté par la suite chez Camara fonctionne extrêmement bien ; un piqué sublime, un autofocus efficace ; bref une optique d'exception.En gros 5/5 pour l'objectif. 0/5 sur Amazon qui m'a envoyé un produit reconductionné.Heureusement j'ai obtenu remboursement."
Happycroco,,Schärfe sitzt an D5300 auf dem Punkt,"Nach den widersprüchlichen Rezensionen hinsichtlich der Exaktheit des Focuspunktes rechnete ich schon mit dem Schlimmsten. Ich packte das Objektiv sehr vorsichtig aus und hob jedes Plastikbeutelchen auf, damit ich alles wieder gut einpacken und zurück schicken konnte.Für mich wäre nämlich ein Einschicken an SIGMA zur Feinjustage nicht in Frage gekommen, da ich nicht bereit bin, Tester für die zu spielen und die Endabnahme ihrer Produkte vorzunehmen.Abner es kam völlig anders: Ich setzte ein unglaublich schickes, schwer-solides und äußerst hochwertig verarbeitetes Objektiv an meine D5300 und begann, in bereits vorbereiteten Sets, bei denen ich wirklich genau die Schärfe auf den Punkt beurteilen konnte, Probeshoots zu machen. Besonders bei f1.8, aber auch kleiner und nicht nur mit dem Kreuz-Mittelsensor, sondern auch mit einigen Sensoren am Rand.Und räumte die ganze Kartonage in den Keller.Ich habe ein richtig tolles WW-Zoom an meiner Kamera, durchgängig mit Offenblende 1.8 und insofern ein weltweites Unikat. Die Qualität der Fotos, auch wenn man sie in Lightroom seziert, ist mehr als beeindruckend, als Immerdrauf an der DX-Kamera ein echter Gewinn.Jetzt hoffe ich auf eine Anschlusskonstruktion von SIGMA im leichten Telebereich und in der Art-Linie."
Florian,,Sehr starke Optik mit minimalen Einschränkungen,"Das Sigma macht vom ersten Moment an einen perfekten Eindruck. Die Verarbeitungsqualität ist meiner Empfindung nach besser als bei den meisten Canon L-Objektiven. Der Zoom-Ring läuft so butterweich und geschmeidig und auch der Fokusring ist sehr präzise und toll verarbeitet. Das schwarze Design der Sigma Art Serie wirkt auch sehr hochwertig.Lieferumfang: Objektiv, Gegenlichtblende, Objektivrückdeckel, ObjektivtascheWas soll man hierzu groß sagen? Für den Preis natürlich ein angemessener Lieferumfang. Verarbeitung und Qualität der Materialien ist einfach nur hervorragend. Die mitgelieferte Tasche bietet im Gegensatz zu den Canon Wildlederbeuteln wirklich einen Schutz und ist ebenfalls sehr hochwertig.Handhabung des Objektivs:Das Objektiv ist für ein Apsc Sensor Objektiv relativ schwer und groß. An meiner 7D II hat es aber eine wirklich schöne Balance und es ist sehr angenehm in der Kombination zu fotografieren. Wie schon erwähnt sind der Fokus sowie der Zoom sehr präzise, gut gedämmt und sehr weichgängig.Autofokus:Der Autofokus ist ein kleiner Schwachpunkt des Objektivs. Der Fokus ist nicht hundert prozentig treffsicher und auch nicht gerade sonderlich schnell. Am Fokussystem meiner Kamera kann das nicht liegen. Die 7D II ist eigentlich für Sportfotografie perfekt geeignet.Man muss dem Objektiv hierbei allerdings kein großes Minus geben. sobald man abblendet stellt der Fokus kein großes Problem mehr da. Bei Blende 1.8 hat man nunmal wenig Tiefenschärfe und es passiert schnell, dass man mal fasch fokussiert hat.Bokeh: Die meisten Sigma Objektive erzielen hier sehr gute Werte und das 18-35 f1.8 bildet hier keine Ausnahme. Das Bokeh ist sehr weich, harmonisch und hat keinen Störenden Einfluss. Die beiden angehängten Bilder sind mit Blende 4 und Blende 5 im Nahbereich aufgenommen. Es wurden keine Bildmanipulationen vorgenommen, lediglich die Belichtung korrigiert. Wie man sieht ist das Bokeh selbst abgeblendet wirklich weich. Bei 1.8 sieht das ganze dann noch homogener aus.Bildqualität:Das entscheidenste an einem Objektiv ist natürlich die Bildqualität. Hier kann das Sigma meiner Meinung nach wirklich glänzen. Faszinierend ist es vor allem wie detailreich Aufnahmen schon bei Blende 1.8 sind. Leicht abgeblendet kann die Schärfe dann wirklich auch mit Canon L-Glas mithalten. Die Farben kommen schön raus und Es gibt wenig Lensflares. Allgemein empfinde ich die optische Qualität des Objektivs wirklich hervorragend.Nachteile:Ich würde mir bei dem Objektiv zwei Sachen anders Wünschen. Zum einen die Brennweite. 18mm sind am Crop nicht wirklich weitwinklig und 35mm sind nicht besonders nützlich. Perfekt wäre das Objektiv meiner meinung nach als 14-30mm Objektiv oder ähnlich weitwinklig. Aber das ist meckern auf hohem Niveau und beeinflusst meine Wertung nicht.Sehr Schade hingegen ist es, dass das Objektiv keinen Bildstabilisator hat. Mit Bildsabilisator wäre das Objektiv einfach die perfekte Wahl zum Filmen und Fotografieren. So werden Videos leider nicht ganz so ""wackelfrei"" wie bei stabilisierten Weitwinkelobjektiven.Leider ist das Objektiv zudem auch nicht Wettergeschützt. Das kann ich nicht nachvollziehen. Es kann ja eigentlich nicht so schwer sein einem qualitativ hochwertigem Objektiv eine kleine Gummidichtung zu geben. Naja nicht weiter schlimm, man wird damit wohl selten im Regen fotografieren.Pros:+ Verarbeitung+ Lieferumfang+ Bokeh+ herausragende Schärfe ab OffenblendeCons:- Kein Bildstabilisator- Kein WetterschutzNeutral:0 Brennweitenbereich0 AutofokusFazit:Ein wirklich tolles Objektiv und jeden Cent wert. Ein Stern Abzug, da einfach nicht alles perfekt ist.4 Sterne für einscharfes, toll verarbeitetes Objektiv, das einem eine Menge kreative Fotografien ermöglicht.Ich hoffe meine Rezension konnte Ihnen bei der Meinungsbildung behilflich sein.Viel Spaß beim fotografieren!"
Domingo Andrés Ramos,,Peazo objetivo!,"Soy fan de este objetivo, me hace alegrarme de tener una cámara APS-C.Cuando me lo enviaron, me di cuenta de que hacía un ruido raro el anillo de raro, como un silbido metálico (supongo que algo que rozaría) me lo cambiaron y en menos de una semana ya tenía uno nuevo en casa. Este funciona perfectamente.Para saber más mejor mirar alguna review, pero en general va muy fino. Perfecto resultado a 1.8 en todo el recorrido, para según quien podría ser un poco lento el autofoco (a mi me parece perfecto) y lo que me parece sensacional es que con el sistema de autofoco dual pixel de la 70D funciona perfectamente."
ExDreamFoto,,Lässt keine Fragen offen.....,"Ich habe mich von Amazon zum Kauf einer Sigma SD1 Merrill mit 18-200mm Objektiv verleiten lassen. Ein Preis von knapp über 1000 Euro für diese Kombi ist kaum zu toppen und die Kombi selbst ist für den Einstieg in die Fotografie mit Foveon-Sensor sehr gut geeignet. Man bekommt sehr schnell ein Gefühl dafür das der Foveon-Sensor irgendetwas anders macht.Die Fotos wirken irgendwie klarer, farblich aufgeräumter, für das Auge natürlicher.OK, Merrill und 18-200, gute Kamera und quasi eine ""Glasscherbe"", ein ""Flaschenboden"", ist das alles?Ich habe mir nun zur Merrill ein Sigma 1.8 18-35 zugelegt und jetzt..............jetzt bin ich geplättet. Erst mit diesem Objektiv zeigt die Kamera was mit dem Foveon Sensor möglich ist. Ich kann jetzt nachvollziehen das in manchen Testen erwähnt wird das es etwa Mittelformat Niveau ist. Hier einige Beispiele:[hier haben Bildlinks gestanden die Amazon weggelöscht hat. Die Möglichkeit bei Amazon Bilder hochzuladen ist jedoch zu belächeln. Was soll ein Bild im Briefmarkenformat über die Qualität von Kameras oder Objektiven zeigen?] --- 1 SternDie Detailauflösung ist für meinen Geschmack phänomenal, wenn man die Auflösung anderer Systeme gewohnt ist. Plötzlich wirken Bilder die ich von anderen Kameras sehe, egal ob C...N...oder S, irgendwie flau und matschig. Achtung, leicht übertrieben dargestellt, aber wie soll man es sonst in Worte fassen?Mein Fazit: Wer unglaublich auflösende Bilder haben möchte, keine Angst davor hat von den ""Etablierten"" belächelt zu werden, wer beim Fotografieren Zeit hat und genau weiß was er tut, der sollte sich unbedingt eine SD1 Merrill und sich dazu ein Spitzenobjektiv wie das 18-35 holen. Ich kann natürlich nur beurteilen wie das Objektiv an der Sigma funktioniert, mir zuckt es aber schon in den Fingern es auch für meine Alpha 77 zu kaufen. Der Merrill hat das Sigma 18-35 jedenfalls geholfen zu zeigen was im Sensor steckt, ich könnte mir vorstellen das dies bei anderen Kameras ebenfalls funktioniert.Ich habe es nicht bereut dieses Objektiv zu kaufen, auch wenn der Preis nicht gerade ein Schnäppchen ist und man beim tragen einen Buckel bekommt.Noch was Negatives.....plötzlich habe ich zuwenige Wände in der Wohnung :-)Optisch: +++Haptisch: +++"
X197ToPlay,,"Top Objektiv, Keine AF Probleme bei Sony A700","Also ich habe mir das Objektiv mal zugelegt dar ich es schon seit ein paar jahren liebäugelte.Zur VerarbeitungDas Objektiv ist weitaus besser verarbeitet als die meisten anderen Objektive die ich kenne!Es fühlt sich sehr hochwertig an und die Grip-Flächen sind ausgezeichnet.Optische LeistungDas Objektiv hat so gut wie keine Farbverfälschungen an den kanten. Bei blende 1,8 und 18mm würde ich mal die gegenblende weg lassen wenn es nicht so richtig hell drausen ist. In meinen zwei hoch-geladenen Bildern kann man das schöne boken des objektives betrachten (Das Rauschen ist von der Kamera) Der 20€ Schein ist auch mit blende 1,8 Fotografiert.AF-bei SonyAlso mit meiner A700 musste das Objektiv bislang nicht Kalibriert werden der AF ist etwas langsam aber sehr treffsicher, wird aber von Kamera und Hersteller variieren!Alles in allem kann man für den Preis nicht meckern was die Leistung und Verarbeitung betrifft! Es stellt auch so manch andere teurere Objektive in den schatten."
Suspeso,,Valor por dinero,"Compré el lente con montura A para Sony y lo uso con mi A6000 con el adaptador de montura E: LA-EA2; el lente está diseñado para sensores APS-C y cumple perfectamente con su misión, la imagen se mantiene bastante nítida desde el diafragma completamente abierto hasta su mínima apertura. Existe una nula aberración cromática y su máxima nitidez he notado que ronda entre F8. Las viñetas se pueden observar en f1.8 pero en f4 son casi invisibles.Cabe destacar que el autoenfoque no es muy bueno con el adaptador y no lo puedo probar con una cámara con montura nativa A. Sin embargo el anillo de enfoque tiene un buen tamaño y no tiene un límite tangible, se sigue deslizando aunque llegues al fin del rango de enfoque. No es el mismo caso con la longitud focal.Es pesado, bastante, y si tu cámara es muy ligera, existe un desbalance al cual te acostumbras pero definitvamente tu cuello o muñecas lo van a sentir después de un rato de uso."
_rob__,,Fantastic lens and fantastic results.,Fantastic lens and fantastic results.Very happy with my purchase!
Andreas V.,,Sehr lichtstarkes und gutes Zoom,"EinsatzzweckIch habe mir dieses Objektiv gekauft, weil ich ein möglichst lichtstarkes Objektiv für Weitwinkel- bis Normalaufnahmen gesucht habe. Ich verwende es für Aufnahmen in geschlossenen Räumen, für Konzerte, Nacht- und Landschaftsaufnahmen. Es ist definitiv kein Universalzoom.MarktsituationMit dieser Lichtstärke als Zoom sicherlich einmalig.Einstellung über USB-DockDieses Objektiv kann man für den Fokuspunkt für 4 Entfernungen und 4 Brennweiten feinjustieren, wenn man glaubt, das sei notwendig. Ich denke aber, dass das eine mehrstündige Prozedur ist, bei der man immer wieder das Objektiv zwischen Dock und Kamera unter möglichst gleich bleibenden Bedingungen wechseln muss. Wenn man Zeit hat und das letzte Quentchen optimieren möchte oder mit Front- oder Backfocusthemen zu kämpfen hat, ist das jedenfalls eine Option. Daneben kann man noch die Firmware aktualisieren.BauqualitätAbsolut top. Im wesentlichen eine Metallkonstruktion. Der Zoomring läuft durchaus mit einigen Widerstand, aber das verstärkt den wertigen Eindruck, der Entfernungsring vorne (!) wie gerne bei Sigma dagegen deutlich leichter. Physisch ist das Objektiv ganz schön schwer, über 700 gr und auch länger als 18-300mm im eingefahrenen Zustand. In meinen Augen ist das Objektiv genauso gut verarbeitet wie ein Zeiss- oder Leica-Objektiv.AutofokusEher langsam, ausreichend präzise. Nichts zu meckern und obendrein über den USB-Dock an die persönlichen Wünsche anpassbar. Es gibt noch einen 'manual override'-Schalter, dessen Empfindlichkeit sich über den USB-Dock einstellen lässt. Der Autofokusschalter ist auch der einzige Schalter des Objektivs.Bildstabilisierunggibt's nicht!BildqualitätBesser geht immer! Es ist eben keine Festbreite, sondern ein Zoom. Bei Offenblende ist es ein wenig weich und wer am Rand nach CAs sucht, wird auch welche finden. Ab Blende 2,8 ist aber alles im grünen Bereich auf dem Niveau von entsprechenden Festbrennweiten.BedienungMan ist immer etwas überrrascht wie klein der Zoombereich ist. Der Zoomring hat bezogen auf den zur Verfügung stehenden Brennweitenbereich einen guten Weg, aber er läuft anders herum als z.B. beim Sigma 18-300mm. Interessant, dass man beim 18-35 mm nach rechts zur größeren Brennweite dreht, während man das beim 18-300 mm nach links tut.ZusammenfassungKlare Kaufempfehlung für Landschaftsfotografie und lowlight-Events, wie Nachtaufnahmen, Konzerte etc."
Khushi,,One of the best lenses for Crop sensor DSLR like Nikon D7100,One of the best lenses for Crop sensor DSLR like Nikon D7100. Gives you 27-52.5 range equivalent to a full sensor camera. This lens is the sharpest and gives outstanding images. This lens is equivalent to most of the prime lenses and has zoom along with autofocus. Only OS is missing which is not a big deal for its size. The zoom ring is towards the camera and the auto focus ring is towards the end of the lens and is confusing at sometimes but you get the hang of it after using. This lens has excellent wide range and is a must for every high end crop sensor camera. The lens is made in Japan by Sigma.
Chris R.,,Für mich derzeit das beste Objektiv an meiner Nikon D7200,"Aufgrund der vielen positiven Bewertungen und den Lobpreisungen in der Presse bzw. Onlinemedien habe ich mich für dieses Objektiv entschieden. Ich bin Hobby Fotograf und besitze seit 2006 meine Nikon D200. Ich habe mich zum größten Teil mit meinem Super Zoom Nikkor 18-200 durchgeschlagen für qualitativ hochwertigere Portraits oder ähnlichem hatte ich meine Festbrennweiten 50/1.4 und 85/1.8 . Die D7200 hat nun aber aufgrund der gut doppelt so hohen Auflösung auch mehr Anforderungen an die Optik als meine gute alte D200. Somit musste neues Glas her. Ich habe mich dazu entschlossen beim unteren Ende anzufangen - für SWW habe ich noch mein altes Sigma 10-20mm, aber das kommt nicht häufig zum Einsatz.Was soll ich sagen, ich bin begeistert von der Bildqualität der Linse. Ich war bei meiner D200 schon etwas frustriert wenn ich mir meine Bilder manchmal in 100% Größe angeschaut hatte. Mit der D7200+Sigma macht auch Crop'en wieder Spaß - falls es mal nötig ist. Mein Objektiv ist schon sehr scharf, deswegen weiß ich noch nicht ob ich mir den USB Dock hole und da versuche etwas zu verbessern.Wie die Bezeichnung ""Art"" schon vermuten lässt, zumindest für mich, setze ich das Objektiv hauptsächlich für Streetfotografie ein - für Portraits ist es dann doch etwas kurz - das wäre mein einziger Punkt was ich mir wünschen würde, wenn es zB 18-50mm, dann wäre es optimal. Aber dann wäre wahrscheinlich nicht diese optische Qualität möglich. Ich kann das Objektiv nur wärmstens empfehlen - wenn man weiß was man fotografieren will und die Brennweite nützlich ist. Mein nächster Kauf wird dann das 70-200/2.8 von Tamron sein mit VC. Dann bin ich gut aufgestellt - das ist dann zwar eine große Lücke von 35-70mm aber hier habe ich ja zur Not noch meine 50mm Festbrennweite."
Bodi,,The lens is amazing but you may need to try a couple of copies to get a good one.,"First off, This lens is known for having Auto Focus issues. a quick Google search can easily bring you to multiple forum posts of people's frustrations and issues with this lens.In the box you get the Sigma 18-35mm lens, a zipper carrying pouch to hold the lens, the Sigma Canada warranty card and the manual.My experience:I bought this lens for my Canon Rebel T6i to use it as my main lens. I unfortunately was one of those people who received a copy that had major front focusing issues with the Auto Focus. Initially I wasn't gonna buy a second copy but this lens was very tempting and it does everything I wanted. For me it's basically three lenses in one.So I decided after Amazon processed my refund I was gonna try and roll the dice again and buy a second copy. I had zero interest in buying the $80 dock and I didn't want to spend hours doing all the calibrations myself to get the Auto Focus to work, so I was prepared to send my second copy in with my T6i to Sigma Canada under warranty if the second copy of the lens had issues as well. (I'm not a fan of sending my camera out in the mail...but who is, right?) I'm very glad to say that I didn't have to do any of that! as my second copy worked flawlessly out of the box!I'm very happy with the amazing amount of detail this lens provides. The 1.8 aperture is great for night time photography and the 18mm makes it a great wide angle lens for my APS-C sensor during the day. I've also been able to get great looking portrait shots at 35mm. I highly recommend buying this lens if you have the cash to do so. The refund process might be a little long if you're not a fan of sending the lens and your camera body in the mail, but it's honestly worth it.I was gonna rate it three stars because of the hassle I had with it but the amazing quality of the lens made me bump it up a star. I would've rated it 5 stars if my first copy was as great as the second one I received. I highly recommend this lens but be warned you may need to try a copy or two. also major props to the Amazon support reps for everything they've done for me regarding this order."
Ulrich Eckardt,,Das beste Objekt,Ich fotografiere schon seit Jahren und habe einige Objektive zur Verfügung. Das Sigma ist jedoch unschlagbar. Ich nutze es zum Erstellen von Videos für meinen Vlog und natürlich zum Fotografieren. Eine excelente Schärfe und LIchtstärke.
Jochen K.,,Das Objektiv ist der Hammer,"Ich bin jemand der gerne bereit ist für ein hochwertiges Objektiv etwas mehr auszugeben. Habe ich in diesem Fall nach lesen einiger Tests dann auch getan. Ich wurde nicht enttäuscht. Der erste Blick fällt erfahrungsgemäß auf die Verarbeitung und Haptik. Hier gibt es absolut nichts auszusetzen. In dem Bereich spielt Sigma definitiv in der Profiliga mit. Was aber letztendlich zählt sind die inneren Werte. Auch hier wurde ich nicht enttäuscht. Die Ergebnisse an meiner Sony A77 II sind absolut beeindruckend. Bereits ab offener Blende knackscharfe Bilder und auch die Ränder brauchen sich nicht zu verstecken. Abgeblendet nochmals eine leichte Steigerung. Das Bogeh ist für mich über jeden Zweifel erhaben. Mit einem Brennweitenbereich im KB-Format von 27-52 mm ab sofort mein ""Immerdrauf"".Fokus sitzt und ist angenehm schnell und vor allem leise.Klare Kaufempfehlung!Okay, das Gewicht ist nicht ohne, aber wer gute Bilder machen möchte muß leiden! ;)"
PaulT,,A top-notch super-fast wide zoom that delivers great value even at it's substantial price point.,"I won't be long-winded here. I'm an enthusiast (not a pro) who has used a variety of gear over 30+ years of enjoying photography. This lens is one of the best I've ever owned (including L series). Solidly constructed, sharp and the f1.8 over its zoom range creates outstanding opportunities for shallow focus in a wide angle that regularly transform routine images into something special, even in super low light (I detest on-camera flash). I know that some of you will look at the price and be a bit off put, but if you are looking to invest in one lens for walkaround shooting, this is it in my opinion. Damn thing rarely comes off my camera."
Raúl Fuentes García,,raulo,"Después de un mes puedo decir que no me ha defraudado. Es lo que estaba buscando, muy buena nitidez, pero muy buena.Lo llevo siempre montado en mi Nikon D7100, a pesar de su gran tamaño y elevado pesoNo le doy 5 estrellas porque el sistema de enfoque automático no es muy bueno, en mi caso presenta un poco de backfocus, pero con la D7100 lo he podido apañar, pero de todas formas para algo está el manual"
eccolo,,Übertrifft die Erwartungen an der Nikon D7100,"Seit der Ankündigung hat mich dieses Objektiv gereizt, es an meiner Nikon D7100 auszuprobieren. Es sollte mein Nikkor 16-85mm f3.5-5.6 ablösen, auch wenn der Brennweitenbereich ein anderer ist. Ausgepackt, ist es ein ganz schönes Trumm. Na, irgendwo muss die Lichtstärke ja herkommen. Die Verarbeitung ist auf den ersten Blick sehr gut, ohne Mängel. Auch das Design zeigt, dass es sich hier nicht um eine 0815-Linse handelt. Die Gegenlichtblende sitzt satt auf dem Objektiv, manchmal muss man schon kräftig Drehmoment aufbringen, um diese abzunehmen. Für meinen Geschmack in täglicher Handhabung ist zuviel Kraft notwendig. Hinsichtlich des Gewichtes - ein Batteriegriff an der Kamera schadet nicht, geht aber auch ohne. Katastrophal ist der Objektivdeckel, gerade bei aufgesetzter Gegenlichtblende gelingt es mir erst nach mehrmaligen Versuchen, diese korrekt aufzusetzen. Sicherlich auch das unwichtigste Bauteil, aber das kratzt an dem gesamten Erscheinungsbild. Genauso wie der AF/MF-Schalter, geht auch sehr schwer. Der Fokusring und Schärfering laufen absolut geschmeidig und smooth - gefühlt besser als einige Profi-Nikon-Objektive. Die Haptik ist Oberflächen ist ansonsten sehr gut, alles fühlt sich sehr wertig an.Nun zu den optischen Eigenschaften: Schärfe der Motive ist ab Blende 2.8 aufwärts in der Bildmitte und am Rand knackig, mehr kann man wohl aus dem Sensor nicht rausholen. Wie Festbrennweite in dem Brennweitenbereich oder besser. Die Bilder sind kontrastreich, farbig, und scharf. Sehr beeindruckend.Einziger Wehrmutstropfen scheint der AF zu sein, der sitzt nicht immer. Für Innenaufnahmen und spielende Kinder absolut ungeeignet. Brilliant dagegen für Archtektur-, Landschafts- und Stadtaufnahmen, da ist es mein Immerdrauf! geworden und hat mein 16-85mm abgelöst. Aufgrund der Größe und des Gewichtes konkurriert es nur noch mit den Festbrennweiten ...zusammengefasst;Besonders gut:- unerreichte Schärfe der Bilder und das schon bei Blende 2.8 über die gesamte Brennweite, da fangen andere Objektive erstmal an; guter Bildkontrast, prima Farbwiedergabe- Bedienung von manueller Schärfe und Focus sehr geschmeidig- Haptik, Wertigkeit und Designweniger gut- Objektivdeckel lässt sich manchmal schwer de-/montieren, AF/MF Schalter geht ebenfalls recht schwer- Autofocus sitzt nicht immer, aber das ist bei andere Objektiven manchmal auch, das ist noch im Rahmenrichtig schlecht- Objektivdeckel muss manchmal rein gefummelt werdenDer Preis ist für die Leistung durchaus angemessen. Ich habe auch das Sigma Dock, habe es aber noch nicht gebraucht, da ich Back-Frontfokusprobleme noch nicht feststellen konnte."
KellerKind,,"Super, mit leichten schwächen.","Ich habe das Objektiv nun einige Zeit in gebrauch und Denke ich kann nun etwas dazu sschreiben.In bestimmten Situationen will ich es nicht mehr missen!Hat man ein schönes Motiv, an das man nah ran kann, kann man schön mit dem Hintergrund spielen.Durch den Brennweitenbereich hat man eine große auswahl an Motiven, vom Portrait bis zum Baum, alles kein Problem.Leider wurde das Objektiv mit einem gehörigen Backfokus geliefert.Meine EOS80D kaann das aber ausgleichen. Ich würde das gerne per USB-Dock korrigieren, aber 50€ ausgeben nur weil Sigma hier an der Qualitätskontrolle spaart, sehe ich nicht ganz ein. Bei Gelegenheit werde ich es Einschicken.Ansonsten ist die Verarbeitung Top.Einen langsamen Autofokus konnte ich nicht feststellen, allerdings nehme ich damit auch keine rennenden oder fliegende Tiere auf.Dennoch ist der Fokus schneller, als der meiner beiden Tamron Objektive.Was ich schade finde - aber kann auch sein das es nicht anders geht? - der Fokusbereich umfasst nur 2 Meter.Das heisst der Bereich in dem man mit der Schärfe der Blende 1,8 schön spielen kann, beschränkt sich auf diese 2 Meter.Alles was weiter weg ist, fällt unter den bereicht Unendlich - ist also leider nicht Cremig wenn der Fokus dahinter liegt.Das fällt mir leider etwas zu oft negativ auf, aber wenn mans weiß, kann damit kalkulieren. Hier ist aber auch ein Anwenderfehler nicht auszuschließen - vieleicht habe ich da was nicht ganz verstanden... deshalb hierfür keinen Abzug in der Bewertung.Schön ist das der Kokusring beim Fokusieren nicht mitdreht, es kann dadurch jederzeit manuell eingegriffen werden ohne auf manuell schalten zu müssen.Alles in allem hat sich der Kauf gelohnt, die Bilder sind Top."
Juanjo,,TOP CLASS,"This is a great Lens in all respects. Quality from wide open is astonishing at center and corners. I was in a doubt about buying this zoom or the 24 mm 1,4 Art, because I already had the 35 mm 1,4 Art and was looking for something to cover the 24 mm focal length with my SD1 Merrill, which is a camera that needs first class or prime lenses to show its potential. After two months of using it, I can assure that quality is on pair with the Art 35 mm if not superior at the corners...And the quality is maintained all over its focal length range.A must lens for the SD1 Merrill serious user. Disregard other kit zoom lenses as the 17-50 mm 2,8 or 17-70 mm Contemporary if you don't want to be disappointed with the results. Go for this one and if possible complete the range with the DC 8-16 mm that exhibits a great quality too for such a Extreme Wide Angle zoom."
sirtalis,,Top,"Es wurde genug zur Abbildungsleistung geschrieben, dem kann man nix gegenteiliges hinzufügen....Einzig die Leistung bei Gegenlicht, was bei einem Foveon X3 Chip gewaltige Probleme bereitet, ist für mich ein Kritikpunkt.Der Fokus könnte etwas schneller sein, sicher auch eine Frage der Kombination mit einer Sigma SD1."
Fabio Massimo,,Lente fantastica ma dall'autofocus inconsistente su Canon 70D,"Pregi: obiettivo nitidissimo, motore molto silenzioso, scarsa aberrazione cromatica, costruzione eccellente, zoom interno (non si estende esteriormente), buona dotazione.Difetti: peso elevato, autofocus ""casuale"" (su Canon 70D), solo per apsc.Acquistato per una Canon 70D, se ne apprezzano le ottime doti quando le immagini sono a fuoco, circostanza che purtroppo si verifica abbastanza di rado e casualmente (in rete la cosa è nota e si ritiene sia causata dal sistema di messa a fuoco di Canon, che per ovvie ragioni non condivide con i produttori terzi le informazioni necessarie ad un corretto funzionamento dell'autofocus). La dock per la regolazione fine dell'autofocus argina ma non elimina purtroppo il difetto. Il peso è abbastanza elevato da rendere l'accoppiata fastidiosamente pesante, se si intende trasportarla per qualche ora di fila, ma d'altronde è noto che gli zoom grandangolari e luminosi non siano affatto leggeri. Costruzione in metallo solidissima e di ECCELLENTE qualità, ottime le ghiere, buono il paraluce. Rapporto qualità prezzo elevato, che renderebbe questa lente un must have se non fosse per qualche imprecisione di troppo nell'autofocus."
Amazon カスタマー,,田舎なので待ち明かりは少ないです。３秒解放で　この星の数が撮影できます。,Ｆ1.8の賜物です。　夏のホタル撮影がたのしみになります。
Roger B,,Que decir de esta optica que no se haya dicho ya...,"Una maravilla. Yo la uso en una GH4 con metabones speedbooster y es una gozada. Es como tener 3 primes en una sola optica. El foco finisimo y muy amplio, unos 180 grados. Nitidez a 1.8 increible. El aro del zoom un poco duro, pero para mi que hago video ya me va bien. Eso si, es como un tanque, pesa que no veas."
Beno,,qualità impressionante,"una lente incredibile come qualità di immagine. La messa a fuoco automatica a volte è imprecisa, ma col dock usb della sigma si tara facilmente back e front focus. C'è però da sottolineare che a f1.8 la profondità di campo è talmente ridotta da rendere molto difficile l'esatta messa a fuoco.Aberrazioni inesistenti, anche se soffre un po' il flare.Unici nei sono peso e ingombro che ne fanno un'ottica impegnativa."
Niko,,Das Millionen - Scoville - Objektiv!,"Nach viel Lektüre von Rezensionen habe ich mich gegen Festbrennweiten entschieden (ich wollte eigentlich nur eine einzige lichtstarke und extrem scharfe Linse) und habe das Sigma geordert. Und: Es hält was es verspricht! Bei mir sitzt der Autofokus perfekt. Bei sehr wenig Licht hat er mal Probleme an der Canon Eos1300, aber dann muss es schon sehr dunkel sein. Selbst bei Blende 1,8 sind die Bilder sagenhaft scharf (deutlich schärfer als an dem Ef-s-is ii-Kit-Objektiv oder auch beim Tamron 70-300mm. Den Bildstabilisator vermisse ich nicht. Schärfentiefe bei 1.8 ist wunderbar winzig und beim Schließen der Blende herrlich zu steuern. Bin völlig baff. Hochgradig inspirierendes Objektiv das zudem noch extrem solide gebaut ist (aber auch dementsprechend schwer ist).Fazit: Gebe ich nicht mehr her! Wer eine Apsc-Cam nutzt und mit dem Brennweitenbereich warm wird sollte es kaufen!"
NinGamer,,Cuidado con la montura,"Si bien se describe como que es para Sony, este lente no tiene montura compatible con la montura E por lo cual hay que comprar un adaptador.Tuve que devolverlo y solicite una corrección de la descripción."
Plamen Angelov,,Best for what it offers and at the same time Best for it's Price,"- 1.8 - great- don't worry about it's short range - it is just like another kit lens.- smooth absolutely silent focus and zoom ring - great for video- very sharp- professional feeling- gread build qialityThe downside is that it is huge and very heavy - almost 1 kilogram and the size of a telephoto vario lens. But you will get used to it.It is a must if you youse aps-c camera and you need high iso, because 1,8 is more than 1,3 EV stop more than conventiona 2.8 varios. Which sometimes may be the difference between iso 1600 and 4000 :)"
David Zeitlin,,Increible construccion,"Que voy a decir que no se haya dicho ya sobre esta lente.Se come a lentes del doble de su precio, Canon, Pentax, Olympus Nikon...No existe nada igual en el mercado de momento, un fluido zoom de 18-35 a 1.8 de apertura (1.2 si usas el Metabones Speedbooster XL 0.64)Hace que mi GH4R tenga una profundidad de campo equiparable a otra cámara con sensor Full Frame.La única pega es que no tiene estabilizador de imagen (IS - OIS - VR - Como quieras llamarlo), pero no todo es perfecto, no?Por más que te veas reviews o leas sobre la lente, pesa mucho más de lo que te esperas, y está construida como un tanque."
franky,,Metabones XL　0.64と組みあわせて、BMPCC4K、6Kで標準レンズ化,BMPCC の4K 6K+Metabones で動画撮影用としてリグを組んで運用してます。レデューサーが必要で、はBMPCC4KでMetabonesのＸＬ（0.64）、ULTRA(0.71)を使うとF1.2で運用できます。50-100mmのレンズも同じです。Metabones使用が一番キレがあります。ＸＬ（0.64）使用時は広角側がけられますので注意。Commliteの0.71（M43用）も持っていますが、やはり画質はMetabonesには及びません。BMPCC4Kを持っている人は、コレかOlimpus12-100どっちは持ってるんじゃないでしょうか。
Dolmades,,Ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo.,"Quest'obiettivo ha una qualità medio-alta ed un prezzo di fascia bassa riferendosi al rapporto qualità-prezzo.Con questi soldi, e puntando alto, solitamente si rischia di prendere un obiettivo che non soddisfa come si sperava e finisce molto spesso come fermacarte da scrivania.Ho eseguito un po' di test, e considerato che non ha lo stabilizzatore, sono rimasto molto soddisfatto dei risultati.Attenzione ad una cosa: la Sigma produce obiettivi compatibili come attacco baionetta di diverse marche, ma la taratura perfetta dell'autofocus con tutti i modelli presenti sul mercato di corpi macchina, è praticamente impossibile da avere all'acquisto (forse con un po' di fortuna...).Infatti anche il mio presentava un leggero FrontFocus a 18mm soprattutto, ed anche leggermente a 35mm, mentre alle altre lunghezze focali era praticamente a posto (i test li ho eseguiti ovviamente ad f1.8).La cosa l'ho risolta con la Basetta Sigma Usb-Dock apposita, il cui uso nel presente caso è semplicissimo.Con la basetta si può aggiornare il Firmware dell'obiettivo e regolare, appunto, l'autofocusSu internet si trova facilmente la scala graduata da stampare per fare i test con tutte le spiegazioni (non è per niente complicato, richiede solo un po' di tempo per via del fatto che si regola la taratura dell'autofocus, e poi si rimonta l'obiettivo sul corpo macchina per rifare i test. Al massimo in un paio di tentativi si riesce ad ottenere il risultato ideale).Consiglio comunque di prendere anche la basetta, che, compatibilmente con l'attacco a baionetta del corpo macchina, consente molte regolazioni anche ad altri modelli Sigma di obiettivi.Saluti"

Elia,,Il top degli zoom per il formato APS-C,"Dopo parecchio tempo che giravo in torno a questo obiettivo, mi sono deciso ad acquistarlo per la mia D7100, rinunciando a venderla per fare una Full Frame.Questo obiettivo scatta super nitido a qualsiasi apertura, e non vi farà rimpiangere una FF con su il classico zoom f/2.8, in quanto quello stop e 1/3 di rumore in meno che si guadagna dal sensore a pieno formato viene riguadagnato da questo splendido zoom luminosissimo esistente esclusivamente per APS-C.Vi ritroverete praticamente al pari con una FF equipaggiata con un obiettivo da f/2.8 per quanto riguarda pulizia dell'immagine e profondità di campo, poiché essa a f1.8 su APS-C è quasi equivalente a f2.8 su FF.La lente è bella pesante, interamente costruita in metallo e chiusa dentro una borsetta rigida ""porta obiettivo"" presente nella scatola.Il paraluce, presente anch'esso nella confezione, è superlativo, ben costruito e molto piacevole al tatto.L'escursione 18-35mm potrebbe sembrare limitante, ma stiamo parlando di un obiettivo che oltre ad essere uno zoom, supera in qualità tutti e 3 i fissi Nikon compresi in questo range.L'assenza di stabilizzazione non si fa sentire a 18mm, e le ghiere sono eccezionali, non uno scatto, sempre fluide, fanno venire la voglia di girarle anche quando non si scatta, provare per credere.Nel mio caso la garanzia era Tedesca, è bastato andare sul sito ufficiale Sigma.de e registrarlo, come si fa con quella italiana M.Trading.Nota meno piacevole, il riscontro dei già noti problemi di autofocus: dovrete comprarvi la dock e perdere un po' di tempo con le regolazioni al fine di avere un obiettivo perfetto. (quasi nessuna reflex si salva dai problemi di autofocus di questa lente).Tirando le somme, se avete il budget giusto ma siete indecisi, quest'obiettivo è quello che fai per voi, non vi farà pentire minimamente dell'acquisto e vi darà grandi soddisfazioni."
Jmac,,Super Sharp,"Ok when I first about this lens I thought whats all the fuss about? After many hours reading reviews I decided to bite the bullet and purchased a Nikon version to attach to my Nikon D7100. I spent several hours shooting and looking at the images on my Mac book Pro retina, and unfortunately I had a few front focussing issues which are obviously magnified at F1.8. (shallow depth of field). I decided to send it to Sigma UK for calibration with my camera body. Once calibrated with the body this lens is a joy to used, the images are pin sharp. This lens is sharp at f1.8 and gets better when closed sown to F2.8. I just love this lens."

Jürgen Arm,,Lichtstarkes Top-Objektiv,"Das Objektiv ist trotz des relativ hohen Gewichtes sehr handlich. Die Innenfocussierung verändert die Länge des Objektivs über den gesamten Zoombereich nicht.Wenn man das Objektiv ohne Sonnenblende einsetzt, sollte ein UV-Filter als mechanischer Schutz angebracht werden, da die vordere Linsengruppe aufgrund des unteren Zoombereichs von 18 mm sehr nah am Objektivausgang liegt.Den fehlenden Bildstabilisator vermisse ich in bei dieser Lichtstärke nicht.Die hohe Lichtstärke über den gesamten Zoombereich ist hervorragend. Gegenüber vergleichbaren Canon-Markenobjektiven hat der Kauf dieses Objektivs einen hohen Preis-Leistungs-Vorteil."

Kindleユーザー,,フルサイズ移行しても使いたい性能,【使用場面等】18-35mmと数字上はかなり広角ということになりますが、APP-C専用ですので、実質的には広角〜標準にあたるかと思います。室内でのテーブルフォトや星景等、あらゆる場面で活躍してくれます。【性能と傾向】この高解像度に歪みのなさ、ズーム全域F1.8の明るさ、更には色の再現性まで、どれをとっても文句のつけようがありません。星景では画面の隅までしっかりと点像で捉えられ、更にF1.8という明るさのため、広角側なら赤道儀なしでも充分に撮影できます。※4枚目は赤道儀なし固定一枚撮影、加工なし。色味は赤〜緑が僅かに強い印象で、Nikonユーザーとしてはむしろありがたい傾向でした。フルサイズ移行後もクロップしてでも使いたくなるような素晴らしいレンズです。
Ste,,Fenomenale,"Sulle caratteristiche ottiche e costruttive dell'obiettivo non è il caso di dilungarsi: online ci sono decine di recensioni di sicuro più professionali ed approfondite di quanto potrà mai esserlo una recensione qui su Amazon.Quello che secondo me conta, in questa sede, è sottolineare che oltre all'obiettivo sono compresi non solo il paraluce (di ottima fattura), ma anche una custodietta di stoffa semirigida, con tanto di incastro interno per la base dell'obiettivo.Davvero, non potevo aspettarmi di più. Grazie."
Markus Kröckel,,Einzigartig und großartig!,"Ich habe dieses Objektiv mit großen Erwartungen gekauft und bin nicht enttäuscht worden. Abbildungsschärfe, Verarbeitungsqualität und Handling liegen meiner Meinung nach auf höchstem Niveau. Der Autofokus funktioniert bei mir in den allermeisten Fällen problemlos. Bei Blende 1,8 fällt natürlich jede kleinste Unregelmäßigkeit auf, das sollte man auch berücksichtigen. Zur Blende 1,8 durchgängig: Ist ein Alleinstellungsmerkmal bei einem Zoom und alleine schon ein Kaufgrund. Einzig im Weitwinkelbereich hätte ich mir noch ein paar Millimeter mehr gewünscht....Mein geliebtes Nikkor 17-50 2,8 habe ich verkauft ohne dabei Schmerzen zu fühlen (-: ich ja jetzt schließlich ein neues Immerdrauf das das ""alte"" schlägt. Sigma ist derzeit mit diesem Zoom State of the art!"
masterac,,parfait pour un apsc,"les apsc souffre d'un capteur qui n'est pas plein format, voila pourquoi il est important d'avoir un bonne objectif pour faire de bonne photo ( meme si cela est vrai pour tout les appareil).ce 18-35 avec une ouverture a 1.8 est juste bluffant, ma mere avait besoin d'un objectif pour son d5100 car elle trouvait que les photo etait floue, je lui ai expliqué que cela etait du a son objectif qui ne s'ouvrait qu'a 3.5.pour ceux qui ne savent pas, en faite ce chiffre 3.5 ou f1.8 pour cette objectif, c'est l'ouverture maximum de l'iris de l'objectif, plus il s'ouvre...et plus il y a de la lumiere, mais pour les chiffre, plus le nombre est grand, plus l'objectif est fermé.pourquoi cela est important ? parce que dans un piece peu eclairé ou dans une zone ou vous ne pouvez pas utilisez de flash, quand vous prenez une photo l'appareil va compenser, et si votre objectif ne peut pas s'ouvrir plus, alors l'appareil va augmenter le temps d'exposition, ce qui veux dire que il va prendre la photo sur plusieurs dixieme de seconde, voir parfois 1 seconde.et nos main ne sont pas faite pour rester stable aussi longtemps...donc il arrive que la photo soit floue."
I. G. CARLO,,Wouahhh,"Je passe d'un 28-105 USM à cet objectif. Beau, lumineux, des images piquées. Les problèmes évoqués de mise au point sont sans doute réglables avec le dock et la faible amplitude de focale est la faible contrepartie d'une ouverture exceptionnelle. A côté d'un 50mm 1.4 de la même marque, ça semble être le début d'un fourre-tout tout à fait acceptable !"

G.C.,,Meraviglia,"Lo dico sinceramente... quasi non uso sltro obbiettivo all'infuori di questo. È incredibile la nitidezza delle immagini che escono fuori da questo obbiettivo, considerando il prezzo. L'ho comprato perchè testato su un set e, visto i risultati, non riuscivo a crederci. Uno dei migliori acquisti mai fatti. Lo uso con una BlackMagic 4k ed è veramente l'unica lente che uso così spesso."
SE,,Spitzenklasse,"Das Objektiv wurde mit Nikon Anschluss über Amazon erworben. Der Versand erfolgte anscheinend direkt von Sigma. Es war jedenfalls nicht in den von Amazon gewohnten Kartons verpackt.Die Verarbeitung ist über jeden Zweifel erhaben. Alles läuft butterweich, jedoch mit einem gewissen Widerstand. Die Streulichtblende ist hochwertig verarbeitet und rastet sauber ein. Einzig den Objektivdeckel hat Sigma immernoch nicht richtig hinbekommen...Der Autofokus ist sehr leise. Der Fokus sitzt bei meinem perfekt.Die Schärfe ist wirklich außergewöhnlich hoch. Farbsäume sind kein Thema. Kontrast und Farben sind auf einem sehr hohen Niveau.Das Sigma sollte mein Nikon 35mm 1.8 ersetzen und schlägt dieses bei Weitem!Ich kann dieses Jedem empfehlen für den exzellente Bildqualität vor Gewicht und dem doch geringen Zoombereich gehen, würde aber Anfängern davon abraten. Um die volle Leistung des Objektives nutzen zu können und entsprechende Ergebnisse zu bekommen, muss man schon genau wissen was man tut. Anfängern würde ich eher zu einem 17-50 2.8 raten. Unkompliziert in der Bedienung, mit Stabilisator und einem größeren Brennweitenbereich kommt man so leichter zu guten Ergebnissen."
SJP,,Best lens in its category,"Fantastic lens! Professional quality built, solid piece of metal and glass. Fast and accurate focus with no visible chromatic aberration or distortion. Minimum vignetting that will probably compliment your pictures and not cause any problems. Have not had any problems with flare or glare so far. Image quality is stunning better than most standard lenses out there and can be compared only to the best professional glasses. Very fast lens, the 1.8 aperture is so liberating for a zoom lens! Incredible sharpness across the frame! Can be used on almost any kind of photography. The only thing I wish it had would be another 15mm of focal length so there would practically be no reason to switch it on my Nikon."
Siggi,,Begeisterung pur!,"Das Objektiv hält, was es verspricht. Ich benutze es an meiner Canon EOS 650D und bin restlos begeistert. Da ich kein Profi-Fotograf bin, erspare ich mir hier Aussagen, die ich nicht fundiert erörtern kann.Ich habe ein paar Probeaufnahmen gemacht und bin von dem Ergebnis überzeugt und freue mich nun auf den Einsatz bei meinen Touren."

Trés lourd! Avec un cobra et mon grip, ça commence à faire, je commence à avoir les bras énorme! haha.Une petite stabilisation n'aurais pas fait de mal.A part ça, rien à dire, je lui met un 5/5!Pour tout les personnes qui avais envie d'acheter un full frame, achetez vous cette objectif, comme moi, ça vous changera cette idée, vous retomberais amoureux de votre APS-C!"

Daniel Drews,,Top Objektiv,"Eines der besten Objektive, dass es zur Zeit für die Canon 70D gibt.Es fässt sich großartig an und von der Verarbeitungsqualität braucht sich das Sigma vor keinem L oder Nikkor zu verstecken, es ist aus Metall gefertigt und eben dementsprechend schwer. Der Zoomring läuft samtweich, genau wie der etwas breitere Fokussierring, welcher sich um ca. 120° drehen lässt. Er dreht beim Autofokus nicht mit und man kann nach dem Fokusieren noch manuell nachfokusieren, wenn man den Fokuspunkt nicht korrekt gesetzt hatte.Zudem ist das Objektive innenfokusiert, d.h. seine Länge verändert sich beim Zoomen nicht.Kaum Streulicht und Geisterbilder und es liefert kontrastreiche Bilder auch bei Gegenlicht.Eine durchgängige Blende von 1.8 und eine hervorragende Bildqualität runden das Bild ab.Für den Preis findet man aktuell kaum ein besseres Objektive für APS-C Kameras."
Sagar Jadhav,,Best lens at this price.,"I love this lens. Had my eye on it since quite some time and finally decided to buy it for my new Canon 80D. Its original lens from Sigma and comes with a lens hood and protective case. The lens is very sharp and give an amazing bokhe, thanks to the f/1.8 aperture across its zoom range."
Miguel,,Usado y defectuoso,"Gastarte 750 € en un objetivo y que envíen uno USADO, con arañazos y marcas de uso, y para rematar con back focus, no tiene precio, ala a tu cajita otra vez y que se lo coma sigma con patatas..."
Miguel S.,,Maravilloso objetivo pero que te pone a trabajar,"Excelente objetivo, pero le doy 4 estrellas por que el enfoque es muy inconsistente en cada distancia focal. Esto es por su apertura amplia, no sé qué tan difícil sea calibrarlo correctamente de fábrica pero por lo menos con mi copia no lo hicieron.Recomiendo a todo interesado en este lente comprar el usb Dock para actualizar el firmware y ajustar el enfoque desde tu computadora. A partir de ahí se vuelve una maravilla, foto tras foto increíblemente nítida a f/1.8, el usb Dock es obligado con tu primer sigma Art.Postdata.- espero con ansias que tengan disponible el 50-100. Llevo varios objetivos para retrato probados, pero después de la calidad de este art no aceptas cualquier cosa."
Amazon Customer,,They are required to be calibrated with a Sigma USB dock to micro adjusting which is a tedious task if you have a telephoto lens,The built of the lens is supers but with one down fall... I would say most of the newer made Sigma lens ( Arts; Contemporary and Sport ) have front and back focusing issues. They are required to be calibrated with a Sigma USB dock to micro adjusting which is a tedious task if you have a telephoto lens.
G82,,Excellent si bonne lumière... et quand il veut bien fonctionner.,"Cet objectif est excellent avec un piqué superbe lorsque la lumière est bonne et qu'il daigne fonctionner. Mais grand mal m'en a pris de l'acheter pour la photo spéléo. Même avec l'assistance quadrillée du flash cobra, la mise au point est très aléatoire en milieu obscur. En manuel, la mise au point sur l'infini donne des photos floues même de f5.6 à f11 Résultat en mode autofocus : plus de 75% de déchets en photo spéléo ! C'est vraiment nul comparé à d'autres objectifs. Question : Pourquoi faire un objectif qui pique superbement et ouvre à f1.8 si on ne peut même pas utiliser l'autofocus en lumière faible ? Franchement, je ne comprends pas. D'autre part, à certains moments il y a des faux contacts et le boitier ""perd de vue"" l'objectif. C'est franchement inquiétant et je vais renvoyer cet exemplaire. Je reprendrai mon excellent 14mm samyang qui est superbe tant en piqué qu'en finition et précision de réglage manuel. Et j'investirai peut-être dans un boitier type d750 un peu plus tard. Mais pour moi, Sigma = deuxième déception. Sans compter un copain photographe qui avait acheté un 300mm f2.8 qui lui a lâché au bout de deux ans, juste après la fin de la garantie... Je ne prendrai pas le risque de commander un nouvel objectif chez cette marque."
Electrosumer,,soddisfatto a parte qualche pecca nella resa cromatica,"L'obiettivo ha un'ottima qualità costruttiva e un'apertura eccezionale. Anche la messa a fuoco è nitida e veloce in tutte le focali. Peccato per la resa cromatica. I rossi non sono fedeli, virano sull'arancione a prescindere dalla temperatura di colore. Niente da ridire sulle ghiere zoom e di messa a fuoco. In definitiva un ottimo prodotto per rapporto qualità prezzo che meriterebbe le cinque stelle se non fosse per la colorimetria."
Raffaele Capannini,,FANTASTICO!,"Obiettivo veramente prodigioso. Di costruzione impeccabile, meglio di moltissimi altri obiettivi più blasonati. La Sigma con la serie ART ha veramente raggiunto livelli impensabili anche solo qualche anno fa. Lo uso su una D90 con una nitidezza da brivido e colori che non ottengo neanche con il Nikkor 50 1.4.Diaframma a 1.8 fisso su tutta la focale per uno sfocato perfetto."
HD Ali,,Überragende Breitband-Festbrennweite,"Dieses Objektiv macht einfach nur Spaß. Schon mit Offenblende sehr gute Schärfe, einfach abgeblendet nur noch superscharf bis in die Ecken und die leichte Vignettierung bei 1.8 verschwindet. Für mich ist dieses Zoom qualitativ auf Festbrennweiten-Neveau. Das Spiel mit Schärfentiefe und Freistellen bei Offenblende erzeugt herrliche Bilder an APS-C. Das Objektiv selbst wirkt wie aus einem Guß und ist sehr hochwertig verarbeitet. Kein Vergleich zu sonst üblichen Plastikbombern. OK. Es ist kein Sportobjektiv. Der Autofokus ist etwas langsamer, aber für Landschaft oder künstlerische Bildgestaltung kann ich es absolut empfehlen."
Cliente Amazon,,"Ottimo in tutto, solo un po' pesante.","Obiettivo di ottima fattura. Costruzione e materiali eccellenti, nessuna traccia di plastiche scadenti, giochi tra le ghiere o altri difetti.Qualità eccellente delle immagini. Molto nitido anche ad aperture ""importanti"".L'escursione limitata dello zoom è una sua caratteristica, non un difetto, se lo si acquista è perchè si scatta principalmente a quelle lunghezze focali.L'unica caratteristica negativa (se proprio bisogna trovarla) è il peso..circa 800 grammi se non sbaglio..che, specie in contrasto con un obiettivo da kit in plastica, può farsi sentire nei primi utilizzi.Consigliato al 100%"
Amazon Customer,,Five Stars,Excellent item
Tiziana De Silvestro,,Miglior ottica per GH4,"La uso su GH4 per video con l'adattatore Metabones Speedbooster XL x0,64 e WoW! ho provato tante ottiche, incluso il 16-35 canon ma questo sta spanne sopra a tutti a mio parere (tralasciando i cine da €4000). Ha una nitidezza assurda e un bokeh che non ti aspetteresti mai ne da una gh4 ne da uno zoom, veramente la lente perfetta a mio parere. Su GH4 in 4k diventa un 26-51 f1.1 mentre in 1080p un 23-44 f1.1 Lente CONSIGLIATISSIMA a chi fa foto ma sopratutto a chi fa video e in specie con la GH4 dato che questa per la suddetta camera è una lente immancabile!"

Torsten U,,Tolles Objektiv mit schlechter Werkseinstellung des Focus,"Ich habe das Sigma 18-35 1,8 für Nikon vor wenigen Tagen bekommen. Auch bei diesem Objektiv musste ich feststellen, dass die Bilder mit den Werkseinstellungen nicht scharf waren. Da ich das Problem von meinem Sigma 50-100 1,8 kannte, habe ich ein Sigma Dock. Beim Einstellen des Sigma 18-35 mit dem Dock fiel mir auf, dass dieses Objektiv teilweise recht eigenartig focusiert. Obwohl die Kamera auf einem Stativ stand und auch das zu focusierende Objekt auf einem zweiten Stativ befestigt war, stellte das Objektiv teilweise ohne erkennbaren Grund ganz woanders scharf. Dieses trat vor allem im Bereich zwischen 2m und ""unendlich"" auf (erhebliches Backfocus). Auch bei den von mir gemachten Fotos konnte ich feststellen, dass die Bilder bis 2m Entfernung super waren, alles dahinter aber Matsch. Das Objektiv ist schon auf dem Rückweg zu Amazon. Ich werde es bei zeiten mit einem zweiten Objektiv versuchen, da es - abgesehen von dieser Macke - einen sehr wertigen Eindruck machte. Schade nur, dass die Werkseinstellungen von Sigma mies waren und dass man ein Dock zum nachjustieren braucht.Nachtrag:Ich habe inzwischen ein zweites Objektiv gekauft. Die Qualität der Bilder ist sehr gut. Der einzige Mangel war auch dieses Mal, dass der Focus erst nach der Einstellung mit dem Sigma Dock passte. Zusammenfassend kann ich sagen: Tolles Objektiv mit schlechter Werkseinstellung des Focus."
Pierre R,,Super objectif avec une BMPCC,"J'utilise cet objectif avec un speedbooster sur une caméra blackmagic et que dire si ce n'est le meilleur objectif que j'ai eu entre les mains. La combinaison et je pense la meilleure à faire pour avoir une image de grande qualité (autre que de louer ou acheter des objectifs spéciaux pour le cinéma). A titre d'exemple j'ai tester ma caméra avec cet objectif et une caméra sony F5 avec un objectif à 20 000€ et mes profs m'ont demandé pourquoi je leur montrais ces images où ils ne voyaient pas vraiment de différences si ce n'est une netteté un peu meilleure sur l'objectif à 20K (j'ai envie de dire, Heureusement). Pour faire de la vidéo c'est excellent. Pour de la photo je n'en ai pas fait énormément, mais ça me semble vraiment très bon pour le prix."
SveBre,,Da passt alles.,"Großartiges Objektiv, dessen Bildqualität jeden ausgegebenen Euro rechtfertigt. Die offene Blende erlaubt einem völlige Gestaltungsfreiheit bei sämtlichen Aufnahmen. Würde ich sofort wieder kaufen."
Stefano,,Spettacolare. Un must have per Aps-c.,"Da quando l’ ho acquistato non l’ ho piu’ smontato dalla mia 750D. È perfetto.Design gradevole, lenti di qualita’, le ghiere sono fluide e ottime per video, luminosissimo e crea un gradevole bokeh! Ottimo anche per scatti a breve distanza dal soggetto, in quanto mette a fuoco fino a 28cm!Che dire, è una lente che per qualita’ si piazza ai livelli delle lenti EF ma che riesce a portare una qualita’ professionale su macchine fotografiche apsc.Ottimo prodotto."
Claas,,Genial,"Fast schon unglaublich welche Schärfeleistung dieses Objektiv bietet! Allerdings verlangt es auch sauberste fotografische Arbeit. Auf dem Stativ fixiert, liefert es mit meiner D7000 phantastisch aufgelöste Bilder!"
Amazon Kunde,,Hochwertiges Objektiv,"Nach längerem Suchen habe ich mich als Sony-Alpha-Nutzer für dieses Objektiv entschieden, da insbesondere Sony-Rezensenten positiv berichtet haben. Mit dem Fokusdetektor von Traumflieger.de bildete die Kamera in allen Einstellungen den Fixationspunkt scharf ab, zumTeil mit einem leicht asymmetrischen Schärfentiefeverlauf mit einer Tendenz zum Frontfokus. Auch im Alltagsgebrauch konnte ich bei meinen Bildern die positiven Eindrücke bestätigen, die Abbildungsleistungen des Objektivs (Freistellung, Bokeh) stellten mich vollauf zufrieden. Nur der Autofokus reagiert im Vergleich zu meinen anderen Sigma-Objektiven sehr langsam, für Schnappschüsse ist dieses Objektiv nur bedingt geeignet. Dass ein Zoom-Objektiv mit dieser Offenblende wegen der großen Linsen ein entsprechendes Gewicht auf die Waage bringt, sei nur der Vollständigkeit erwähnt; dafür liegt es auch satt in der Hand. Insgesamt macht das Objektiv einen hochwertigen Eindruck."
Daniel E.,,Semiprofessionelles Gesamtpaket,"Da ich mich über den Durchschnitt von nur 4 Punkten gewundert habe, möchte ich nun meinen eigenen Senf zu diesem Objektiv loswerden. Ich besitze eine Nikon D7100, mit der ich sehr zufrieden bin. Das Sigma 18-35 mm F1,8 DC HSM verwende ich mittlerweile als Immerdrauf, wann immer ich keine Lust habe, mehr als 1 Objektiv mit mir herumzutragen. Ich möchte im Folgenden darlegen, weshalb es für mich keine Alternative zu diesem Objektiv gibt.1.) Der Brennweitenbereich deckt sowohl den Weitwinkel von 18 mm als auch den Beginn der mittleren Brennweiten mit 35 mm ab. Damit ist man in der Lage gute Landschaftsaufnahmen, aber auch Portraits, die ein wenig die Umgebung mit einbeziehen, zu machen. Natürlich wäre nach oben hin ein bisschen mehr Brennweite wünschenswert. Allerdings würde dies noch mehr Glas und noch mehr Gewicht bedeuten und grade der Kompromiss zwischen Gewicht, Verarbeitungsqualität und optischer Qualität ist mir das höchste Anliegen. Dies leitet über zum Punkt ""Güte"".2.) Der Markt ist voll von Zoomobjektiven. Allerdings sind diese häufig nicht lichtstark und meist auch optisch von schlechter Qualität. Das Sigma 18-35 1,8 DC HSM wird in diversen Tests als Sammlung von Festbrennweiten angepriesen. Ich kann das aus eigener Erfahrung bestätigen. Als Besitzer einer Crop-Cam war für mich die Lichtstärke ausschlaggebend, um dem Vollformat in Sachen Tiefenunschärfe, Bokeh und Low-Light-Capability einigermaßen nahe zu kommen. Sigma hat bewiesen, dass das möglich ist. Tests zu Folge bildet das Objektiv über den kompletten Brennweitenbereich bei jeglicher Blendeneinstellung scharf ab. Das ist, was ich suche. Was nützt mir ein Objektiv, das zwar einen größeren Brennweitenbereich mit sich bringt, aber bei Offenblende quasi über weite Strecken nicht zu gebrauchen ist? Stattdessen packe ich, wenn es noch ein zweites Objektiv sein darf, mein Nikkor 50 mm F1,8 oder mein Nikkor 85 mm F1,8 mit ein. Ich spreche hier von Reisen, aber auch von Geburtstagen, Feste auf kleinerem Raum. Für größere Räumlichkeiten empfiehlt sich natürlich ein Telezoomobjektiv als Ergänzung an. Nun habe ich den Faktor Schärfe erwähnt, der durchgehend erfüllt wird - egal, welche Blende ich zur Bildgestaltung einsetze. Entscheidend ist neben der Schärfe weiterhin die durchgängige Offenblende von F1,8. Diese ist nach wie vor einzigartig im Zoombereich! Und grade bei Crop-Cams ein MUSS. Solch ein Wert ermöglicht nicht nur geringere Isowerte bei Dunkelheit, sondern eben auch sehr viel mehr kreativen Spielraum in der Bildgestaltung bei Tageslicht! Ich werde einige Bilder mit anhängen, um Ihnen die Vorzüge zu veranschaulichen. Von Portraits sehe ich ab, um die Privatsphäre der Modelle nicht zu strapazieren.3.) Die Verarbeitung der Art-Linie ist einfach hervorragend. Das Ding ist schwer, aber es hält sich in Grenzen. Im Vergleich zu einem 70-200 F2,8-Objektiv ist es geradezu ein Leichtgewicht. An der D7100 ist es sehr gut ausbalanciert und liegt gut in der Hand. Die Kombi fühlt sich sehr solide an. Man hält kein billiges Plastik in den Händen. Das weiß jeder semiprofessionelle oder professionelle Fotograf definitiv zu schätzen, wenn er die Erfahrung erst mal gemacht hat. Für mich, eine Optik für die Ewigkeit. Ich habe früher oder später vor, mir eine zweite Kamera aus dem Vollformatsegment anzuschaffen. Dann stehe ich aber vor dem Problem, dass es für diese Modelle stand heute kein vergleichbares Objektiv gibt - auch nicht von Sigma. Das 24-35 mm ist schwerer, weniger flexibel einsetzbar und teurer. Wahrscheinlich würde ich in diesem Fall eine Festbrennweite wie z.B. ein 20 mm oder ein 24 mm empfehlen und als Ergänzung ein 24-70 mm Zoom oder einige weitere Festbrennweiten.4.) Im letzten Abschnitt möchte ich noch auf die Autofokusproblematik eingehen. Ich persönlich hatte mit meinem Exemplar zum Glück keine Probleme mit Front- oder Backfokus. Ich habe mir dennoch das USB-Dock für alle Fälle zugelegt. Die Serienstreuung ist unverschämt und die Geschäftsidee, fehlerhafte Kalibrierung via USB-Dock den Kunden ausgleichen zu lassen, einfach nur unter aller Sau. Aus Sicht von Sigma jedoch, kann ich das Modell in gewisser Weise nachvollziehen. Die großen Hersteller genießen einen viel besseren Ruf und können ihre Produkte leichter an den Kunden herantragen und auch sehr viel leichter auf die eigens hergestellten Kameras abstimmen. Die einzige Möglichkeit für andere Hersteller, auf sich aufmerksam zu machen ist der geringere Preis. Weil der ambitionierte Fotograf aber dennoch auch immer die Qualität im Auge hat, muss irgendein Kompromiss eingegangen werden. Bei der aktuellen Produktions- und Vermarktungsstrategie setzt Sigma auf hohe Qualität bei geringem Preis und relativ schlechtem Service. Allerdings sollte man sich doch fragen: Selbst wenn man ein Montagsmodell erwischt; Entweder kalibriert man es selbst, oder schickt es zur Überholung zurück. Danach hat man trotzdem ein ausgezeichnetes Objektiv, das in seinen Eigenschaften nach wie vor seinesgleichen sucht. Ist es das Risiko oder die Umstände nicht wert? Ich finde schon und daher die 5 Sterne. Ich hoffe Ihnen hiermit weitergeholfen zu haben :-). P.S.: Ich liebe gute Nikkor-Optiken. Aber man sollte auch links und rechts die Augen offen halten. Ich bin also kein grundsätzlicher Sigma-Fanboy. Es lohnt sich z.B. auch ein Blick auf die neue Tamronlinie an Festbrennweiten!Edit: Ich bin nach wie vor (08.03.2018) sehr zufrieden mit dem Objektiv. Ich kann mich an eine (wichtige) Situation erinnern, als der Autofocus mal öfters nacheinander deutlich daneben lag. Nach einiger Überlegung kam ich zu dem Schluss, dass das aller Wahrscheinlichkeit nach mit dem Objektivwechsel zwischen dem Sigma 18-35 F1,8 und dem Nikon 16-80 F2,8-4 zu tun hatte. Es kommt dabei vor allem noch hinzu, dass ich die Kamera vor dem Wechsel der Objektive nicht ausgeschaltet habe (was ich sonst eigentlich immer tue...). Sicherlich hatte die Firmware der Kamera dadurch gewisse Schwierigkeiten...P.S.: Ich hänge noch ein weiteres Bild an, um sich eine noch bessere Vorstellung von der Bildwirkung und insbesondere des Bokehs zu machen, das meiner Meinung nach für ein APS-C-Zoom sehr sehr ordentlich ist.Edit (18.04.2018): Inzwischen bin ich dazu übergegangen, anstatt dem hier rezensierten Sigma das ebenfalls hervorragende Nikon 16-80 mm F4 immer dann als einziges Objektiv mit mir herumzutragen, wenn ich möglichst leichtes und trotzdem sehr gutes Equipment dabei haben möchte. So toll das Sigma 18-35mm auch ist - es ist mir trotz allem auf Wanderungen zu schwer und auch ansonten im Urlaub recht einschränkend. Die positiven Eindrücke der obigen Rezension gelten natürlich (unter anderen Einsatzbedingungen) dennoch."
Rick Bimmler,,Beste APSC Immerdrauf,Schärfe des Objetives außer Konkurrenz. Ich vermisse den Bildstabilisator auch nicht. Die oftmals angesprochenen Probleme des AV-Modus habe ich nicht gespürt.Ohne IS sollte man aber die Regel 35mm / 1/50sec etwas nach oben verlagern. Mit 1/100 hat man keinerlei Probleme.

Timo,,Mein neues Lieblingsobjektiv,"Da ich gerne bei Dunkelheit fotografiere (Milchstraße o.Ä.) wollte ich ein Weitwinkelobjektiv mit möglichst offener Blende. Um etwas flexiebler zu sein, habe ich mich dann für dieses Zoom-Objektiv entschieden. Top Abbildungsleistung, sehr gute Verarbeitung und gute Haptik beim Fokusieren.ABER:Leider musste ich zu dem Objektiv einen SpyderLENSCAL (70€) und den USB-Dock (40€) von Sigma kaufen, da es wie viele Sigma-Objektive leider unter dem bekannten Autofokus-Problem litt. Zudem hat es ein echt stolzes Gewicht, hat keinen Schutz gegen Spritzwasser (was in dieser Preisklasse eigentlich dabei sein sollte) und der Autofokus ist recht langsam. Deshalb nur 3/5!"

willi2013,,Ein Traum von einem Zoom Objektiv,"Lange Zeit verwendete ich mein Nikon 16-85 mm Vr als sogenanntes ""Immer drauf"" an meiner D7200. Die Ergebnisse waren ansprechend, allerdings war die Blendenöffnung 8 in fast allen Brennweitenbereichen erforderlich, um scharfe Abbildungen zu bekommen. Bei Tageslicht kein Problem, Freistellungen durchaus möglich...aber kein Vergleich mit dem Sigma 18-35 mm 1:1,8.Die Bilder sind von einer auffälligen Klarheit und Schärfe, wie man sie nur bei Festbrennweiten sehen kann. Super Freistellungsmöglichkeiten über den gesamten Brennweitenbereich hinweg, geeignet auch für Portraits bei 35 mm und ein passabler Weitwinkel, wenn's mal etwas eng wird. Der Autofokus sitzt, ein eventuelles Kalibrieren mit USB-Dock schließe ich für mein Teil aus.Vorrangig für Reportage/Alltag, aber auch Landschaftsfotografie denkbar. Durch die Offenblendentauglichkeit werden gestalterische Freiräume eröffnet, die so mit einem Zoom Objektiv an DX vorher nicht möglich waren. Wer nicht zu oft das Objektiv wechseln will, dem sei diese Linse wärmstens empfohlen."
Cedric T.,,Deux focales fixe à grande ouverture dans un zoom à un prix accessible.,"Acheté comme objectif principal pour mon reflex, il me donne entière satisfaction : bien construit, lumineux, piqué optimisé pour les grandes ouvertures. A part son encombrement par rapport à mon boitier EOS 500D, je suis toujours enchanté des photos obtenues au flash cobra ou à main levée (la stabilisation qui n'est pas présente ne m'a jamais manquée).Vivement le passage à un boitier plus conséquent (7D MkII) afin d'avoir un ensemble mieux équilibré."

Je suis déçu car j'ai lu beaucoup de bons articles sur cet objectif, et n'en ai tellement voulu. Mais je le revois car l'objectif qui coûte 740€ et qui a un problème avec la mise au point sur toutes les photos - ce n'est pas pour moi."
Andy,,Geniales Objektiv,"Ich habe wegen dem Preis lange überlegt, wollte mir eigentlich wegen der Lichtstärke eine Festbrennweite zulegen. Mit diesem Objektiv ist man natürlich wesentlich flexibler, eigentlich drei Festbrennweiten in einem Objektiv. Bisher hatte ich an meiner Nikon D5100 immer das Kit-Objektiv Nikkor 18-105, die mangelnde Lichtstärke hat mich immer etwas geärgert. Inzwischen ist das SIGMA mein Immerdrauf, natürlich muss man die geringere Brennweite mit den Füßen ausgleichen. Die Haptik und die Verarbeitung sind hervorragend, speziell bei wenig Licht spielt das Objektiv in einer anderen Liga als das Kit-Objektiv (welches trotzdem in Bezug zum Preis ordentliche Fotos macht). Allerdings empfehle ich das Objektiv nur Fotografen, keinesfalls den Knipsern, welche nur den Automatikmodus ihrer Kamera kennen. Die richtig guten Fotos macht man nur, wenn man die Einstellung der Kamera selbst übernimmt und sich über die Zusammenhänge über Brennweite, Belichtungszahl und ISO im Klaren ist."
fkom,,Irre Qualität,"Hab mich selten so gefreut mit einem neuen Objektiv, Lichtstark mit toller Abbildungsleitung bei konstanter Blende. Einfach klasse! Ich liebe es."
MW-SOFT Computer,,Sigma 18-35 1.8 DC: Eine großartige Linse!,"Nachdem ich schon längere Zeit auf der Suche nach ein oder zwei sehr lichtstarken Festbrennweiten für den Weitwinkelbereich war, bin ich zufällig über Testberichte für dieses einzigartige Objektiv gestoßen. Da soll es also ausgerechnet ein Zoomobjektiv geben, das den ganzen klassischen Weitwinkelbereich und die Normalbrennweite am APSC-Sensor abdeckt, überall die Blende 1.8 zur Verfügung stellt und bei dieser unglaublichen Offenblende auch noch schärfer ist als so manche teure Festbrennweite. Erst als ich alle Testberichte, die im Netz verfügbar waren, studiert hatte und alle zu dem gleichen guten Ergebnis gekommen waren, habe ich mir dieses Glas bestellt.Die Lieferung erfolgte mit der für Amazon gewohnten Präzision und Geschwindigkeit. Alle Papiere waren in Ordnung und das Objektiv augenscheinlich unbenutzt.Die ersten Tests fielen dann allerdings sehr wechselhaft aus. Mein Autofokus mochte mit dem neuen optischen Gerät nicht wirklich klarkommen. Mal war ich begeistert, mal enttäuscht. So etwas kann wirklich frustrieren. Ich habe dann kameraseitig Feinjustage um Feinjustage probiert, aber irgendetwas stimmte nie so ganz. Schließlich habe ich mir das USB-Dock von Sigma dazugekauft, das den Fokus für 4 Brennweiten und je 4 Entfernungen – also 16 Werte - einstellen kann. Das Ermitteln dieser Werte war zugegebenermaßen ein recht großer Aufwand, aber es hat sich gelohnt. Die Werte wurden an diversen Testcharts und Testobjekten probiert und immer weiter optimiert. Am Ende war das Objektiv in allen Brennweiten und bei allen Entfernungen scharf. Und wie scharf! Das zeigten auch die praktischen Aufnahmen im Garten, auf Ausflügen und auf einem Konzert. Allein, dass man bei einer 1:1 Vergrößerung keinen sichtbaren Unterschied zwischen Offenblende und Blende 5,6 (hier ist das Sigma etwa am schärfsten) ausmachen kann, war schon sehr beeindruckend. Das diese Schärfe dann auch noch in den Randbereichen nicht erkennbar abfällt, war einfach ein Erlebnis. Zudem bemerkt man fast keine Vignettierung und auch Verzerrungen halten sich auf hohem Niveau zurück. Die CAs sind ehr durchschnittlich, aber das kann heute jede gute Software wie Lightroom mit einem Klick wegrechnen. Lens Flares soll es wohl lt. Presse bei starkem Gegenlicht geben, aber ich hatte bis jetzt noch keine Probleme damit. Dazu ist es innenfokussierend und der Autofokus ist recht schnell und fast unhörbar. Was will man mehr?Fazit: Das Sigma 18-35 1.8 ist jeden Euro wert und noch mehr! Daher mal 5 SterneEs ist zugegebenermaßen nicht leicht, aber es ersetzt auch 3 Festbrennweiten. Der Preis ist ordentlich, aber auch hier gilt, dass schon zwei Festbrennweiten deutlich teurer wären ohne besser zu sein.Noch ein Wort zum Testen: Das 18-35 1.8 ist so scharf, dass man anfängt, sich an kleinsten Abweichungen zu stoßen, die eigentlich nicht praxisrelevant sind. Auch haben die meisten Linsen keine Offenblende mit 1.8, was dazu führt, dass man natürlich am Sigma 18-35 Fehler sieht, die bei Blenden 3,5 und höher aufgrund der Schärfentiefe gar nicht mehr auffallen können. Und was man nicht sieht, hält man für gut. Zudem macht jeder Autofokus auch mal einen „Fehlschuss“. Meine Canon verlegt bei 5-10% der Bilder den Fokus grundlos in den Nahbereich, egal wohin ich ziele. Das ist aber durchaus normal und fällt nur bei entfernten (> 6m) Motiven und bei weit geöffneten Blenden (<3.5) überhaupt auf. Ich hatte es in zwei Jahren daher gar nicht an meinen andern Objektiven bemerkt. Lichtstarke Objektive mit ihrer naturgemäß geringen Schärfentiefe sind aber unerbittlich und decken auch solche schwächen der Kamera gnadenlos auf. Dieses Verhalten einiger Canon-Modelle ist übrigens auch einem mir bekannten Buchautor und Forenbetreiber für Fotografie (Stefan Groß, [...]) schon aufgefallen, wie er mir in einem Gespräch mitteilte. Auch bei Nikon und anderen sind ähnliche Phänomene bekannt, was diverse Forenbeiträge belegen.Auch noch etwas zum SIGMA USB-DOCK: Es wird im Netzt heiß diskutiert, ob das nun eine gute Sache sei, da jeder sein Objektiv in 16 Messbereichen optimal an seine Kamera angleichen kann, ohne das Ensemble zum Abgleich einschicken zu müssen oder ob Sigma hier einfach schludrig arbeitet und den Kunden das durch Eigenarbeit ausbaden lässt. Ich kann nur für mich entscheiden: In den zwei Tagen des Testens habe ich nicht nur wirklich optimale Werte für meine Kamera/Objektiv Kombination gefunden, ich habe auch das 18-35 sehr gut kennengelernt und kann es jetzt bestimmt besser nutzen. Ich werde gern noch weitere Objektive anschaffen, die diese einzigartige Möglichkeit bieten. Ich hoffe auf eine ähnlich gute Anschlussbrennweite 35-90mm 1.8 von Sigma und natürlich dann mit Bildstabilisator und bitte wieder unter 1000 Euro "
Mattia Bioli,,Non passerò a full frame per questo,"A parer mio. La miglior lente sul mercato, ovvio, è solo per Apsc, ma vi assicuro che dopo che comprerete questa lente farete a meno anche del full frame, unico difetto, è poco lipofila e tutte le vostre impronte rimarranno sul body, basta pulire periodicamente."
luzzi,,とてもよかったです。,おすすです！
Jose Morales,,De los mejores objetivos,"El poder obtener esa luminosidad en todo el rango focal es una maravilla. El precio es algo elevado, pero viendo la competencia es razonable. Algo pesado para llevarlo montado todo el tiempo. Problema es que solo sirve para sensores APSC. Por lo demás muy bien. Amazon cumplir con su compromiso de entrega."
Tobias Herschmann,,Das Art ist echt smart!,Sehr scharf! Sehr schönes Bokeh! Guter Brennweitenbereich zum filmen. Sehr wertig verarbeitet! Mit Abstand mein Lieblingsobjektiv!!! Werde die Linse auch als Videoobjektiv an meiner Panasonic Lumix G9 mit Metabones Speed booster benutzen. Dieses Setup ist dann eine echte Waffe mit diesem Objektiv!
Marcin,,Das beste Objektiv für ASP-C-Kamera.,Ich bin sehr zufrieden. Der objektiv ist super scharf aber für die besten Ergebnisse muss man Live-Ansicht benutzen. F1.8 kompensiert gut fehlende Bildstabilisierung.
Desies Arnaud,,Excellent objectif,"Super choix, qualité d'image et de construction excellentes, on a l'impression d'avoir la qualité d'une focale fixe ! Je ne m'en sépare plus."
christophe,,Le cailloux pour EOS 70D,"Alors, dès que l'on a passé l'étape des micro réglages, cet objectif est une pure merveille ! Il ne quitte plus mon boitier ! Soit, les 35mm, c'est un peu court lorsque l'on est habitué à un 18-50, mais l'on s'y fait très vite, et au vu de la qualité des clichés réalisés avec la ""bête"", on oublie vite les 15mm qu'il nous manque ;-)."

Martin Kaiser,,Ein Traum von einem Objektiv!,"Wer auf Verarbeitungsqualität und Abbildungsleistung Wert legt, wird vermutlich (wie ich) die oftmals als Negativpunkt ausgelegte Größe und das Gewicht schätzen: an Wertigkeit kaum zu übertreffen, kommt ein Stapel von Prime-Linsen um 18, 24 und 35mm wohl auf das gleiche Gewicht - nur, dass das Objektiv ALLE Brennweiten DAZWISCHEN auch abdeckt!Sollte der Autofokus einmal nicht zu 100 % treffen, so lässt sich das recht einfach mittels des USB-Docks korrigieren.Macht wirklich Spaß damit zu arbeiten!"
jpz,,sigma,Rien à signaler livraison dans les normes et produit de bonne qualité extrement lumineux surtout si vous utilisé un speedbooster cequi augment sa luminosité par exemple sur le sigma 18-35 vous passez de 1.8 à 1en ouverture
David G.,,Gran objetivo pero...,Excelente objetivo pero el mio vino con un grave problema de front Focus. No corregible con el dock.Algo grande y pesado pero muy nítido en cualquier abertura y focal.
Cryoxy,,Objectif performant si un calibrage précis est réalisé sur le boitier propriétaire,"Dés l'objectif reçu, je le monte sur mon boitier EOS 70D , l'autofocus placé sur le collimateur central et je prends une photo à 9, 10m d'une fresque ayant beaucoup de détails . Je grossis à la loupe numérique du boitier , plein centre , la photo prise et là ... ouh les détails sont tous flous .. Ah , alors , je reprends une photo bien posé , idem . Ouh aille aille , le super objo Sigma pour APS-C f/1,8 meilleur du monde en piqué, se révèle avec un problème . Je remets mon Canon EF 17 - 40 f4 L pour comparaison et là, la loupe à fond, des détails hyper précis et pas de flou sur la photo . Panique à bord , stress ... ! l'objo est raid .Après recherche et un peu de lecture sur le back et le front focus, ""c'est quoi ce truc sur un objo neuf de ce prix plutôt élevé !"" , je m'aperçois qu'il faut ajuster la bête . J'utilise le fn13 d'ajustement focus de mon boitier pour chercher le micro ajustement parfait en moins ou en plus et là , sur le coup bien puis à une autre focal la photo est encore toute flou avec vérif en grossissement à la loupe. J'ai de quoi vérifier la puissance du piqué en suivant les tests références des barres graphs en copie ci dessous de Photozone, Photodo .Apres lecture toujours , je dois acheter le dock Usb pour faire la liaison avec le soft sigma et l'objo . Installation sur le PCLiaison , connexion et je tombe sur une feuille à 16 valeurs qu'il faut renseigner car tout est à Zéro dans la grille.j'adapte à chaque valeurs de focal et de distance, la correction que j'ai apporté dans mon boitier pour être bien net au collimateur central. Mais je ne suis pas satisfait car cela n'est pas reproductible .J'appelle le service après-vente Sigma France , un technicien super sympa et très patient , c'est rare , merci encore . me renseigne . Si dans l'éventualité que je n'aboutirai pas en final à quelque chose de correct/parfait , il me dit qu'il faut leur envoyer l'objo et mon boitier , cette prestation est gratuite entrant sous garantie car maintenant l'ensemble est un ""couple"" appairé.. . Ah , je ne suis pas chaud pour envoyer mon boitier par courrier , même pendant plus ou moins une semaine . Apres plusieurs conseils à suivre , je reprends mes réglages , je recontrôle les valeurs de la grille.Je change mon mode opératoire , car en mode live view et zoom X 5 ou X 10 en fonction de la distance, les photos sont toujours nickels et super nettes , donc cela vient de l'autofocus interne avec le systeme collimateur .Je me procure des mires de différentes tailles selon la distance pour obtenir une détection au contraste ( et ceci est très important) sans faille à 0 mm du sujet et bien perpendiculaire , une régle à 45 ° pour détecter/apprécier la zone de netteté avant et apres le zéro . . le pied pour ne pas avoir de flou de bouger , le déclencheur également. A chaque prise de vue je tourne la bague de mise au point pour que le moteur de l' AF fasse son boulot et pas le fainéant, je prends aussi 2 à 3 photos du même réglage à f/1,8 pour être sur de ne pas avoir un flou de bougé ou autre .Utilisation des mires à 25X de la Focale et 50X de la focale. Apres çà , c'est à dire une trentaines de modifs téléchargées dans l'objo , j'obtiens une netteté très correcte , voire superbe .En conclusion pour moi il a fallu de très gros décalage +18 aux extrémités de la focale +19 et une méthode de détection AF imparable . Photo des réglages en copie ici , j'en suis à la version 22.8 .... ! C'est peu dire et pas moins de 500 photos prises pour le réglage et l'affinage .Il me reste à finaliser selon l'ouverture f1,8 , 2,8 , 4 .. etc .. car cela se décale un peu de la zone de focus , de l'ordre de l'unité .Pour faire l'infini, plus délicat j'ai réglé à 3 m, puis à 10 m , puis contrôlé au loin en prenant les tuiles d'un toit , affinage à f/2.8 , f4 , f5.6 , c'est plutôt bien , je fige les valeurs sur le tableau colonne infini .Une étoile de moins pour cette galère , de plus, je ne peux pas prêter cet objo car il est appairé a mon boitier maintenant ( probabilité impossible d'avoir le même décalage). Je vérifierais si il va bien sur celui de ma fille un EOS 700 D . Sinon c'est ultra piqué, précision terrible bien plus que mon EF 17 - 40 mm f4 L .Soit disant que dans le futur les nouveaux objo seront comme çà .... ! pour être super encore plus fort. J'espère qu'ils feront qq chose de plus facile pour le calibrage d'un objectif neuf.Par contre nouvelle découverte , je n'ai quasiment plus besoin de mon flash , c'est donc pas mal cette ouverture f1,8"
G. Hencke,,Das Warten hat sich gelohnt!,"Gleich vorbestellt und seit vorgestern mein Eigen. Das Sigma 18-35 F1.8 DC HSM für Nikon.Sofort ausgepackt und gleich ist mir das ordentliche Gewicht und die tadellose Verarbeitung ins Auge gefallen. Etwas, dass Sigma vorher nicht so gut gemacht hat. Hier: Hut ab! Nichts knarzt, hochwertig verarbeitet, Zoom und MF-Ring laufen sauber und weich. Zwar ist die Linse nicht wirklich leicht, aber hält sich an meiner D7000 gut und sicher in der Hand. Man hat das Gefühl, einen Panzer vorne dran zu haben :)Bildqualität: Erste Tour nach draußen und das positive Gefühl setzt sich fort. Bereits bei Offenblende sind die Ergebnisse 1A, abgeblendet von großer Schärfe und Detailreichtum über den gesamten Brennweitenbereich. Die Farben sind kräftig authentisch. Der Fokus ist flüsterleise und trifft relativ ordentlich. Mir ist kein Front- oder Backfokus aufgefallen. Die mitgelieferte Sonnenblende tut was sie soll. Ich habe den Eindruck, trotz des hohen Gewichtes mein immerdrauf gefunden zu haben.Chapeau Sigma!"
Horst,,"Skeptisch wegen Fokus, jedoch restlos begeistert!","Hallo,das ist wohl meine erste Rezension die ich auf Amazon schreibe aber ich möchte meine Eindrücke gerne teilen.Ich hab lang mit mir gerungen ob ich dieses teure objektiv kaufe. Ich war skeptisch wegen der vielen Fokusprobleme die hier genannt wurden und auch anders wo. Da aber auch sehr viele von dem objektiv schwärmen habe ich mich getraut es zu bestellen. Und ich bin restlos begeistert. Es fühlt sich und sieht absolut hochwertig verarbeitet aus. Die Ringe drehen sich super smooth mit angenehmen widerstand aber nicht zu schwer. Die Gegenlichtblende rastet perfekt ein und sieht ebenfalls hochwertig aus.Dann direkt nach draußen und die ersten testfotos und Nahaufnahmen. Die große Spannung ob der Fokus sitzt. Dann die Erleichterung - sehr treffsicher und meiner Meinung nach da wo er hin sollte. Die Aufnahmen sahen bereits auf dem Kameradisplay wesentlich besser (schärfer, tolle Farben usw) aus als mit meinen anderen objektiven. Die Schärfe ist durchaus auf Niveau meiner 50 mm Festbrennweite 1.8 von Canon. Beim direkten Vergleich am pc in der Vergrößerung zum Kitobjektiv fällt direkt die bessere Qualität auf. Lediglich meine 17 Megapixel der Kamera beschränken die bildqualität beim reinzoomen.Bildstabilisator hat es nicht aber vermisse ich auch nicht. Wer kein Hampelmann ist und sich auch mal Zeit für ein gutes Foto nimmt wird ihn nicht vermissen. Ebenso finde ich das Gewicht nicht störend. Klar es wiegt einiges aber ich fühlte mich direkt mit wohl. Nutze tue ich es an einer Canon 1300D.Der Brennweitenbereich ist für mich ausreichend. 18-35 mm reicht aus und alternativ habe ich noch das Canon 50 mm dabei sowie ein 70-200 mm. Die paar MM die nun nicht abgedeckt sind fallen nicht negativ auf.Offenblende 1.8 bei 18 mm! Ein Traum und dazu eine gute naheinstellgrenze. Selbst Landschaften lassen sich freistellen. Ungewöhnlich aber hat was. Auf 35 mm ist das Bokeh super schön und eignet sich finde ich sehr gut für portaits als Alternative zum 50 mm.Ich finde aber es ist ein objektiv für Fortgeschrittene und nicht für Schnappschussmacher. Der Schärfebereich bei offenblende ist sehr gering! Vielleicht sind die fehlen Fokusprobleme auch zum Teil Benutzerfehler. Leichtes Bildausschnitt korrigieren nach fokussieren kann schon zum verrutschen des Schärfebereichs führen. Man muss sauber arbeiten und sich auch mal Zeit nehmen für Fotos dann hat man auch wenig Ausschuss. Übrigends habe ich mit jedem objektiv Ausschuss was auch normal ist! Daher nicht direkt aufs objektiv schieben sondern Vlt auch mal sich selbst hinterfragen.Super ist auch dass man bei bedarf am schärfering manuell im AF eingreifen kann falls der Fokus bei schlechten Licht doch mal nicht so perfekt sitzt.Alles im allen bereue ich den Kauf nicht und hab aktuell auch nicht den Bedarf das objektiv justieren zu müssen.Von mir klare kaufempfehlung. Anbei noch zwei Fotos gestern bei Nacht. Eines mit Stativ und eines Freihand."
Juan Jose Alvarez Martinez,,No enfoca bien,"'Me pasa lo mismo que a Paulo: el objetivo enfoca perfecto, siempre que uses la pantalla (live view). Enfocando por el visor, tanto en modo de autoenfoque One Shoot como en AI Servo, no enfoca bien casi nunca, y en mi caso haciendo tests (fotografías siempre a la misma distancia contra unos textos con buen contraste), puedo comprobar que sucede en todas las aperturas. Lo peor es que es inconsistente, a veces desenfoca un poco, a veces mucho, y a veces (raras) enfoca bien. Se puede ver enfocando por el visor y viendo el valor del medidos de distancia de enfoque: cada vez que enfocas es distinto. Por lo que no creo que se pueda arreglar con correcciones de la cámara (que en mi caso no tiene) ni con el dock de Sigma (que no me apetece comprar para arreglar un objetivo tan caro).Por lo que he leído en internet, es un problema muy común con éste objetivo.De momento como estoy en los primeros 30 días voy a pedir un reemplazo por otro igual a Amazon, después si vuelve a suceder tendré que contactar con el servicio técnico a ver si se puede calibrar (pero sólo tienen en en Barcelona y yo en Madrid, por lo que imagino que tendré que hacer un envío) o reemplazarlo por otro objetivo como el Canon 17-55 2.8.PS: si el nuevo objetivo que me mande Amazon o el servicio técnico solucionan el problema actualizaré la puntuación."
HV,,Top!,"Das Sigma ist super, die Bilder wirken klar und von astreiner Qualität. Endlich lassen sich auch im halbdunklen gute Aufnahmen machen."
Eugene,,Great lens for portraits,Lens was great deal bought it second hand
Mr. CC,,Rucksack voller Primes,"Ich nutze dieses Objektiv an einer Nikon D5300. Dank dieses Objektiv bekomme ich 18 Mpix aus der Kamera raus (laut dxomark). Die Schärfe ist besser als die meisten Festbrennweiten dafür ist es auch Schwer wie zwei Festbrennweiten. Es verzeichnet kaum, ist schärft in den ecken ab Blende 1.8 und 18mm, Vignettierung gibt es kaum.Das Stück Glas ist mein immer drauf geworden. Ich fotografiere damit Landschafen und Menschen. Ja man kann damit auch gut Portraits im Querformat mach mit ein bisschen crop. 18 Mpix ist eh zu viel Schärfe für Portraits.Das Objektiv ist so lang, dass man beim internen Blitz einen Schatten wirft. Man muss also Externe Blitz benutzen. Aber mit Blende 1.8 brauch man kaum ein Blitz.Die Nahdistanz ist mit 28 cm sehr klein(für groß macro, Produktfotografie). Mit der Blende von 1.8 bekommt man ein unglaubliches Bokeh hin. Es ist das Schönste Bokeh was ist jetzt gesehen habe. Butter weich! Vergleichbar mit Zeiss Objektive.Solche Objektive mach Vollformat Kameras ""fast"" überflüssig. Also Daumen hoch von mir!"
Rolf Nußbaum,,Endlich mein Traumobjektiv,"Auf dieses Objektiv habe ich schon 25 Jahre gewartet,da ich kein Freund von Festbrennweiten bin.Ich hatte mir zwar geschworen trotz meiner schlechten Erfahrungen,nie wieder ein Sigma-Objektiv und nur noch Original-Objektive zu verwenden,aber aufgrund der sehr guten Tests und des deutlich gesunkenen Preises,habe ich mir dieses Objektiv zugelegt.Und ich muß sagen: Hut ab, Firma Sigma ! Schon der erste Eindruck beim Anfassen ist überaus positiv und erinnert mich an Canon's L-Objektive. Doch dann die ersten Bilder mit Blende 1,8 : Überaus scharf und kontrastreich über alle Brennweiten hinaus. Endlich ein Objektiv bei der die grösste Öffnung voll nutzbar ist. Auch konnte ich weder bei meiner EOS 40D, noch an der EOS 650D einen Front-bzw Backfocus entdecken.Da ich die meisten Bilder bei ISO 100/200 mache und ich die Lichtstärke jetzt voll nutzen kann,ist das ohnehin fast nicht vorhandene Rauschen kein Thema mehr.Auch bei ISO 400/800 und bei sehr schlechten Lichtverhältnissen ist das wenige Rauschen mit einer guten Bildbearbeitung (Lightroom 5) gleich beseitigt.Alles in allem ist es eine große Freude mit diesem Sigma-Objektiv zu fotografieren und ich konnte bis jetzt keinen Schwachpunkt entdecken."
Client d'Amazon,,Problème de font focus,"Objectif de qualité en terme de fabrication.Piqué superbe quand vous arrivez à prendre une photo correcte...Effectivement problème de front focus, j'ai donc retourné le boitier et l'objectif chez sigma pour réglage.Au retour même déconvenue...J'étais déjà un peu désabusé de devoir renvoyer un objectif à ce prix, et je le suis encore plus...Je vais l'échanger pour reprendre une focale fixe Canon."

Oliver Albrecht,,"Film-, Fotoobjektiv für BMPCC & Panasonic GH4 | Adapterwahl MFT zu EF | Videoreview","Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Besonders im Bereich Film sind viele Filmcrews und Kameraleute auf die besten Objektive der Welt angewiesen, jedoch sind die meisten wirklich guten Objektive außerhalb der Preispannen die besonders kleine Teams und Kameraleute sich leisten können. Da die Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera und auch die beliebte Panasonic GH4 mit einem MFT Mount kommt fallen normalerweise EF Objektive aus dem Programm doch dank einem MFT zu EF Adapter ist das dennoch möglich.So bringt Sigma einen neuen Glanz in die Welt der MFT Kameras und erzeugt lichtstarke und scharfe Bilder für die Filme der Teams die auf die Technologie der MFT Kameras setzen. Natürlich können auch Canon Kameras wie die EOS 600D welche ich habe damit verwendet werden (ein paar Fotos dazu sind am Ende der Rezension angehangen!)------------------Tipp für Adapterwahl: Es gibt manuelle und aktive Adapter für MFT zu EF Objektive diese haben jeweils unterschiedliche Vor- und Nachteile auf diese ich mal kurz eingehe - mein persönlicher Tipp ist der Aputure Lensregain, warum steht unten.Manuelle Adpater haben KEINE ELEKTRONIK und können dadurch keinerlei elektronische Signale durchleiten (es gibt daher keinen Autofokus oder Blendensteuerung, elektronischer Bildstabilisator wird nicht angesteuert) Fotodiox Lens Mount Adapter, Canon EOS EF, EF-S Lens to Micro Four Thirds System Camera such as Panasonic Lumix, OM-D & BMPCC Aktive Adapter: Es gibt aber auch aktive Adapter diese haben fast immer einen ""Focal Reducer / Fokusreduzierung"" dadurch wird die Blende vom Objektiv um bis zu 1 Stop verbessert, ein Autofokus ist möglich und der elektronische Bildstabilisator wird auch angesteuert. Besonders interessant ist jedoch der Fakt das besonders die Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera mit einem Crop-Faktor (Vergrößerung der Brennweite) von 2,88x kommt das würde dann aus einem 18-35mm Objektiv ein ca. 50-100mm Objektiv machen - der Focal Reducer verinngert das um 0,75x (aus dem 18-35mm wird dann theoretisch ein 38-75mm Objektiv mit einer Blende von 1.2 anstatt 1.8) Aputure DEC lensregain Kabelloser Fernbedienung Adapter für Micro Fourthirds (MFT) Mirrorless Cameras ------------------Lieferumfang:---------------------Das Sigma 18-35mm f1.8 Objektiv kommt in einer wirklich sehr guten Verpackung mit einer kleinen Objektivtasche zusammen mit Anleitung, Garantiekarte, Objektiv und auch der Sonnenblende. Besonders auffällig für das Sigma ist das Material welches einen sehr sehr hochwertigen Eindruck macht - Das Objektiv ist wirklich sehr schwer aufgrund des Metallgehäuse.Inbetriebnahme:---------------------Wie ein Objektiv an einer EF-Kamera genutzt wird brauche ich hier wohl nicht erklären, aber ich gehe trotzdem mal fix drauf ein. Das Objektiv hat einen roten Punkt am Ring welcher genau auf den Roten Punkt der Kamera gesetzt wird und dann im Uhrzeigersinn aufgedreht wird um es zu befestigen. Das gleiche macht man auch bei der Blackmagic und der Panasonic GH4.Leistung & Qualität:---------------------Das Objektiv stammt aus der A-Serie (die ""Arts"" Serie von Sigma steht für Qualität und scharfe Bilder laut Sigma) und genau das merkt man nicht nur bei dem Gewicht des Objektives sondern auch bei der Qualität der Abildungsleistung. Die Blende von 1.8 ist sehr beeindruckend, denn meines wissens nach ist Sigma mit dem 18-35mm f1.8 wohl einer der ersten Hersteller die es geschafft haben ein solches Obektiv auf den Markt zu bringen.Durch die Blende von 1.8 kann man beruhigt mit dem Zoom-Objektiv auch auf Reisen perfekte Fotos machen wenn es mal etwas dunkler ist draußen bzw. drinnen. Auch die Tiefenschärfe kommt durch die 1.8 einfach nur perfekt rüber. Die Schärfe der Fotos ist unabhängig von der Kamera einfach nur gestochen scharf (besonders in der Preisklasse ist eine solche Klarheit, Schärfe und Blende sehr selten, bis nie zu finden)Autofokus & manueller Fokus---------------------Der Autofokus des Sigma ist sehr schnell und trifft auf den Punkt, auch bei Low-Light Situationen kommt durch vergüteten Linsen eine ideale Scharfstellung zustande. Was jedoch einfach klasse gelungen ist, merkt man bei der Situation das nach einem Autofokus das manuelle überschreiben der Schärfe jederzeit via drehen des Schärfereglers möglich ist (man kann quasi im AF Modus trotzdem manuell nachschärfen!). Der manuelle Modus arbeitet leichtgängig, leicht und dennoch nicht zu leicht, sodass keine versehentliche Veränderung der Schärfe passiert.Objektiv an MFT Kamera---------------------Wie bereits vorab beschrieben ist für die Verwendung des Sigma 18-35mm EF Objetives ein Adapter notwendig der es schaft MFT zu EF umzuwandeln. Je nachdem welchen Adapter man verwendet bringt dieser einige Funktionen mit sich (ich bin im Video bewusst auf den Lensregain ""siehe oben"" eingegangen da der manuelle Adapter mittlerweile eingemottet wurde bei mir.)Wie bereits oben beschrieben ist an der Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera das Sigma 18-35mm Objektiv mit einer Brennweite von 38-70mm zu vernehmen, dadurch ist der typische Filmbereich 35mm und 50mm relativ gut abgedeckt. Was jedoch besonders gut durch das Objektiv wirkt ist die 1.8 Blende (durch den Adapter auf 1.2) dadurch kriegen die Aufnahmen einen sehr guten Look, was besonders im Bereich des Abends, Dämmerung klasse durchkommt. Wer jedoch auch Nachts einmal ein paar Aufnahmen machen möchte sollte bedenken das bei ISO 400 und der 1.2 das Bildrauschen zwar kaum zu erkennen ist, jedoch immernoch vorhanden ist.Für die Verwendung des Objektives bei Tag sei eine kleine Warnung ausgesprochen, denn hier spreche ich den Tipp aus das durch das 72mm Filtergewinde einige gute ND-Filter verwendet werden können (bitte achtet darauf das ein <10€ Filter die Abildungsleistung des Objektives nicht sonderlich verbessert - meine Empfehlung ist Hoya als Hersteller). Durch einen ND-Filter können auch bei einer Blende von 2.2 am Tage wundervolle Aufnahmen gemacht werden und man erhält den typischen Filmschärfe-Effekt (der Hintergrund wirkt sehr unscharf - ist im Video zu sehen!).Fazit---------------------Ein Objektiv kann man nur schwer empfehlen, denn es ist immer eine etwas subjektiv Meinung mit dabei. Das eigene Empfinden kann ich bei der Bewertung nur schwer raushalten, denn ich bin einfach begeistert vo der Leistung des Objektives für seinen Preis (und das muss an dieser Stelle erwähnt werden!). Besonders für semi-professionelle und Fortgeschrittene Fotografen und Videografen ist dieses Objektiv der ideale Begleiter.Wer noch nicht überzeugt ist, kann ja mal die Videoreview von mir anschauen und sich dann entscheiden ob es passt - ich hänge zusätzlich noch ein, zwei Fotos an die Rezension dran."
Tim,,Achtung: keine Verlängerung der Herstellergarantie auf drei Jahre möglich!,"Ja, eine Rezession sollte nur das Produkt bewerten. Aber ich möchte auf Umstände eingehen, die vielleicht nicht jedem klar sind.Das Objektiv selbst ist - wie hier schon oft beschrieben - sehr gut: die Bildqualität (an einer 70D) ist spitze - auch bei Offenblende, die Verarbeitung und Haptik hervorragend und beim Zoomen und Fokussieren ändert es weder die Länge noch dreht sich die Frontlinse. Es bietet eine Lichtstärke für Brennweiten, für die es so schlicht keine vergleichbare Festbrennweite geschweige denn ein anderes Zoom-Objektiv gibt. Wer auf Lichtstärke aus verschiedenen Gründen an einer Crop-Kamera braucht, wird um dieses Objektiv meiner Meinung nach nicht herumkommen.Andererseits ist es relativ schwer, einen Bildstabilisator hat es nicht und der Zoombereich dürfte gerne einen oder zwei Millimeter früher beginnen und bis 50mm reichen. Aber diese drei Punkte kennt man vor dem Kauf und sind absolut kein Grund für Punktabzug. Es ist und bleibt ein sehr potentes Objektiv.Das wären dann also glatte 5 von 5 Sterne.Wie ich eingangs sagte, man sollte nur das Objektiv selbst bewerten, und so gibt es auch keinen Punktabzug, dass erst beim zweiten Objektiv der krasse Front-Fokus überhaupt per USB-Dock korrigiert werden konnte; beim ersten, das ich erhalten habe, hat der Korrekturbereich gerade im Weitwinkel nicht ausgereicht.Daher am besten das USB-Dock gleich mitbestellen und darauf hoffen, es einstellen zu können (dauert ca. 2-3 Stunden). Was ich von der Notwendigkeit des Docks und der kundenseitigen AF-Einstellung halte, lasse ich einmal unkommentiert.An meiner 70D trifft nach der eigenen Feineinstellung der AF bei Offenblende auch insbesondere mit dem mittleren AF-Punkt sehr genau. Bei dieser geringen Schärfentiefe muss man allerdings sehr präzise arbeiten und beim verschwenken (also erst auf das Motiv mit dem mittleren Sensor fokussieren und dann das Motiv per Kameraschwenk in eine andere der Bildkomposition zuträglichen Position rücken) dürfte oft das Motiv selbst unscharf werden. Dafür kann das Objektiv jedoch nichts.Was aber einige vielleicht noch nicht wissen: Amazon verkauft offenbar Objektive, die nicht für eine Verlängerung der Herstellergarantie qualifiziert sind. Beim Versuch, dies auf der Sigma Seite zu tun, bekommt man die Fehlermeldung, dass die Ware nicht für den deutschen Markt bestimmt sei (Tippfehler und eine zu späte Registrierung kann ich ausschließen).Meine Anfragen an Amazon und Sigma sind bisher ohne Ergebnis; falls sich etwas neues ergibt, ergänze ich diese Rezession.Wer also dieses Objektiv und auch andere (z.B. Sigma 17-50mm f/2.8 EX DC OS HSM) hier kauft, sollte darauf achten, dass auf der Verpackung ein silberner Aufkleber aufgebracht ist, der explizit auf die Garantieverlängerung hinweist. Fehlt dieser, hat man wie es im mitgelieferten Garantiezettel steht nur ein Jahr Herstellergarantie (und zwei Jahre gesetzliche Gewährleistung). Man kann dann damit leben oder es zurückschicken. Aber man sollte sich darüber bewusst sein.Ich finde es von Amazon nicht schön, dass sie darauf nicht hinweisen, auch wenn sie es nicht müssen. Von Sigma finde ich es ebenso inakzeptabel, dass einerseits mit drei Jahren Herstellergarantie geworben wird, aber offenbar Online-Händler wie Amazon solche Objektive nicht verkaufen (dürfen). Das war für mich ein wichtiger Grund, diese Rezession zu verfassen und dem einen oder anderen Kunde ein böses Erwachen zu ersparen.Ich habe übrigens in einer Recherche keinen anderen Online-Händler gefunden, der dieses Sigma Objektiv mit Hinweis auf eine mögliche Verlängerung der Herstellergarantie verkauft. In entsprechenden Foren sind die Kunden darüber auch nicht begeistert. Scheinbar gilt die Garantieverlängerung tatsächlich nur für Händler, die ihre Ware vor Ort im Laden verkaufen.Positiv für Amazon möchte ich hervorheben, dass das erste defekte Objektiv problemlos ersetzt wurde und auch sonst der Service absolut problemlos und kulant abläuft.Da das Objektiv selbst wirklich klasse ist (sofern es denn richtig fokussiert), tue ich mir mit den Sternen schwer. Ich ziehe daher nur einen Stern ab. Es ist wirklich ein Jammer: gerade dieses Objektiv zeigt, dass Sigma sehr, sehr gute Objektive bauen kann, doch bekommt Sigma dieses ewige Problem des verstellten Autofokus nicht in den Griff. Dann noch die zusätzliche Verwirrung bei der Garantie. Das macht es einem nicht gerade leicht, sich für ein Objektiv dieses Herstellers zu entscheiden.Update: der Fokus saß auch beim 2. Exemplar nicht richtig. Dank des Programms Focal von Reikan, der Dot-Tune-Methode und der Hilfe des folgenden Artikels ([...]) funktioniert das Fokussieren jetzt deutlich besser. Der Knackpunkt des Artikels: es reicht nicht immer aus, das Objektiv per USB-Dock einzustellen.Wer diesen Aufwand nicht treiben will, sollte sein Exemplar direkt nach dem Kauf gut überprüfen, auch bei unterschiedlichen Abständen zum Motiv und unterschiedlichen Brennweiten. Mein Tipp wäre, bei nicht akzeptablen Abweichungen das Exemplar als defekt zurückzuschicken."
Jaso,,Not as sharp as I imagined.,"Truly excellent build quality and speed. Nice and quiet autofocus, which struggled a little in various lighting conditions at times.Wasn't happy with sharpness using my K-50 however. Perhaps it was a 1 off.Returned thanks to Amazons great service.Would love another, but before I do, I think I'll get a K-3"
Chris,,Contentissimo,F 1.8questo dice tutto. Foto e Video bellissimi e il look che da e veramente grandioso!18-35mm vanno benissimo e su APSC il look e favoloso!
Andy,,Spitzen Objektiv! ...nach Kalibrierung mit Sigma USB-Dock...,"Absolut empfehlenswerte Linse mit der vielleicht besten optischen Leistung aller Zooms für das ASP-C Format. Da ich bisher lediglich Festbrennweiten für andere Brennweitenbereiche hatte, habe ich noch etwas für den Bereich <50mm, in welchem ich einen Großteil meiner Fotos erstelle, gesucht. Das 35 1,8 war als Erstes auf dem Programm. Dies ist wohl auch besser wenn man etwas sehr leichtes und günstiges sucht. Ich habe mich dann aber für das Mehr dieses Objektivs entschieden und es nicht bereut!Haptik, Verarbeitung usw. ist wie schon öfters beschrieben über jeden Zweifel erhaben. Ja, es ist relativ schwer, für mich ist dies jedoch kein Problem. Ganze Tagestouren mache ich normal nicht und selbst bei Wanderungen mit 5-6h hatte ich auch früher schon kein Problem ähnlich schwere Objektive mit zu schleppen. Das muss jedoch natürlich jeder für sich entscheiden.Getoppt wird das Ganze nur noch von der optischen Leistung! Bessere Abbildungsleistung als alle meine Festbrennweiten! Und sogar bei Blende 1,8 schon fast auf Höchstniveau. Bokeh ist auch wirklich gelungen.Ja, und dann der Autofokus… Ich hatte natürlich auch schon vor dem Kauf über die Probleme gelesen und mir deshalb den Sigma USB-Dock mit bestellt. Auch mein Objektiv hatte von Werk aus einen Frontfokus. Das Problem ist hier halt auch, dass man durch die geringe Naheinstellungsgrenze und die Spitzenleistung bei 1,8er Blende dazu verleitet wird, sehr oft mit sehr, sehr geringer Schärfentiefe zu arbeiten. Bei genauem Nachprüfen stellt man oft auch bei den anderen Objektiven leichte Fehler fest, welche man dort jedoch in der Praxis meist nicht sieht.Auf jeden Fall habe ich es ausführlich getestet und kalibriert. Wer nach einer Methode sucht wie man dies macht, empfehle ich bei gwegner.de nach ""Sigma USB Dock Fokus kalibrieren"" zu suchen!Ich habe bei der dort beschriebenen Methode jedoch immer nach dem Fokussieren mit Kontrast-AF erst den Fokus kurz manuell verstellt und dann nochmals mit Phasen-AF scharf gestellt. Ohne das Verstellen hat er bei mir teils den AF stehen gelassen, obwohl beim ganz frisch fokussieren eine kleine Abweichung sichtbar war. Auch würde ich nicht nur einen Durchlauf zum kalibrieren machen. Ich habe 3x alles durch gemessen. Mir kam es so vor, als ob durch die Korrekturwerte bei z.B. 18mm auch die daneben liegenden 24mm Werte wieder leicht beeinflusst werden. Evt. erzeugt die Software hier eine Korrekturkurve welche quasi geglättet ist?Alles in allem habe ich hierfür ca. 2-3h aufgewendet. Das ist bei so einem Produkt zwar ärgerlich, jedoch handelt es sich hier halt auch um einen Grenzbereich des Möglichen, wo sich die anderen Firmen vermutlich genau deshalb noch nie dran gewagt haben. Bei mir hat das Kalibrieren auf jeden Fall gut funktioniert. Die Konstanz liegt bei mir jetzt für die große Blendenöffnung auf einem sehr hohen Level!Wenn es mal kalibriert ist, ist es wirklich sensationell was man hiermit aus einer ASP-C Kamera raus holen kann!Deshalb kommt für mich, mit meinem Exemplar, außer 5 Sterne nichts in Frage!"

Pauline,,Exceptionnel!!,"C'est un objectif exceptionnel!D'une part, en le tenant en main on ne peut que constater la qualité de la fabrication.Et d'autre part, pour une photographe amateur comme moi, il sublime nos image."
-Neo-,,"Super, wenn man das richtige Objektiv erwischt!","Es brauchte 3 Anläufe, bis ich ein funktionierendes Objektiv in den Händen hielt. Das erste hatte einen nicht unerheblichen Frontfokus, der in seiner Stärke je nach Licht und Brennweite variierte. Daher ließ er sich auch nicht über die Kamera zuverlässig korrigieren. Ich schickte es zurück und bekam ein zweites, jedoch hatte ich hier genau das gleiche Problem. Sogar die Stärke des Frontfokus war fast gleich und genauso unzuverlässig und daher nicht einstellbar.Ich fing an an meiner Kamera zu zweifeln und ging mit meiner Canon 70d zum Einstellen zu Canon. Die versicherten mir, dass der Autofokus meiner Kamera hervorragend funktioniere, allerdings hätte das Sigma einen starken Frontfokus - auch an anderen Kameras. Also ging auch das zweite Objektiv wieder zurück zu Amazon.Ich wollte es noch ein drittes Mal probieren und ging diesmal zum Fotoladen-um-die-Ecke (bei mir Foto-Gregor) und testete das Sigma ausgiebig vor Ort. Das Ergebnis: es funktionierte perfekt. Kein Front- oder Backfokus, schnelle lautlose Fokussierung, auch bei Offenblende und schwachem Licht, also nahm ich es mit.[*****] BildqualitätEgal ob F1.8, F8 oder F16: das Objektiv ist gestochen scharf. Etwas abblenden erhöht zwar noch ein wenig die Schärfe, aber nur minimal und nur wenn man ganz genau hinguckt. Damit kann man die Blende voll zur Steuerung der Tiefenschärfe und für Available-Light-Aufnahmen nutzen: toll!Nur leichte Vignetrierung in den Bildecken und so gut wie keine Verzerrung machen eine Nachbearbeitung der Bilder überflüssig und man kann sie direkt übernehmen. Andere berichten von leichten CAs in den Bildecken - ich konnte bisher noch keine entdecken. Einfach nur genial![*****] VerarbeitungTop. Objektiv aus Metall, Fokussierring und Zoom drehen sich genau mit dem richtigen Widerstand, nichts wackelt, knarzt oder macht sonstige Geräusche. Und auch die Sonnenblende sitzt fest, wackelt nicht und hat sogar eine kleine Gummilippe. Klare 5 Sterne! Bei den zwei anderen Objektiven, die ich vorher hatte, war das übrigens anders: der Zoom hatte einen viel zu großen Widerstand, sodass ich geschlagene 2 - 3 Sekunden brauchte um von 18 auf 35mm zu kommen oder umgekehrt. Dabei klapperte auch noch das Objektiv in der Kamera, da es etwas Spiel hatte.[****.] GewichtJa, es ist etwas schwerer - dafür ist es komplett aus Metall. Ich empfinde das Gewicht jedoch nicht als störend - ganz im Gegenteil. Es wirkt dadurch sehr wertig und erleichtert verwacklungsfreies Knipsen.[****.] Available LightDas Sigma wird ein Standardzoom mit F2.8 und Optical Stabilizer ersetzen. Die Lichtstärke von F1.8 ist zwar überragend, aber aufgrund des fehlenden OS geht die zusätzliche Lichtstärke in die schnellere Belichtungszeit um verwacklungsfrei zu fotografieren. Also entweder hat man ein Stativ dabei, oder eine sehr ruhige Hand. Wenn nicht bringt das Objektiv bei AL keinen Vorteil gegenüber des stabilisierten 2.8ers.[***..] AutofokusIn 90% aller Fälle super. Bei schwachem Licht und bei Offenblende hingegen kann man ihm leider nicht ganz trauen. Macht man ein Bild mithilfe des Autofokus und klappt danach den Spiegel hoch und fokussiert über Live View, so stellt man fest, dass sich der Autofokus hin und wieder etwas vergreift. Siehe dazu die zwei Bilder von Thomas-i-Punkt mit Auschnittsvergrößerung. Wenn man sicher gehen möchte, sollte man bei schwachen Licht sein Foto noch einmal genau kontrollieren oder fokussiert gleich mit Live View: dann sitzt der Fokus nämlich immer zu 100%.Davon abgesehen ist er super: schnell, präzise, leise und innenfokussiert![****.] Fazit:Es gibt von mir eine klare Kaufempfehlung. Die Abbildungsqualität ist über jeden Zweifel erhaben und durch die tadellose Verarbeitung macht es einfach nur Spaß es zu benutzen. Wegen der Fokussprobleme gibt es von mir einen Stern Abzug: man muss seine Bilder im Nachhinein nochmal auf Schärfe kontrollieren. Außerdem scheint es auch bei diesem Sigmaobjektiv eine Serienstreuung zu geben: also nach dem Kauf am besten den Autofokus auf Herz und Nieren prüfen und im Zweifel muss das Objektiv halt zurück - leider! Aber nicht aufgeben: es gibt sie, die perfekt funktionierenden Objektive. Man muss sie halt nur finden!"
Tobias Schenckell's,,O%bjectif très performant.,"Je modifie mon commentaire car j'utilise cet objectif depuis un bon moment et l'on peut dire des choses plus pertinentes à son sujet.1 - L'objectif en lui même : Le produit est dans un emballage impeccable, livré avec une housse semi rigide et dès la prise en main on sent bien la qualité de la réalisation. Cet objectif à connu les températures en été, l'hiver, et je fais de la photo en mode manuel la plupart du temps ce qui m'amène à réellement l'utiliser au niveau des bagues.Il résiste très bien. J'ai eu un tout petit souci de back et front focus que j'ai très vite solutionné avec l'affinage du réglage du dock que l'on achète à part.L'objectif dispose de plusieurs type de fixations autrement dit si vous avez un Canon ou un Nikon il faudra le préciser à l'achat.2 - Pourquoi choisir cet objectif ?Sigma a tapé fort avec ce produit. Focale variable 18 à 35mm, on est donc sur du grand angle idéal pour les paysages voir des portraits. Cet objectif a été conçu pour des capteurs au format APS-C qu'il exploite bien.Sa focale fixe maintenant... Il faut savoir qu'en général, un objectif avec focale variable aura ce type de caractéristiques dont l'exemple qui suit est assez typique : 18-55 f/ 3.5 - 5.6. Cela veut dire en gros que vous aurez une ouverture très lumineuse avec une longueur de 18mm et un maximum à f/3.5 mais vous serez moins lumineux à 55mm avec une ouverture maximum à f/5.6. Entre les deux l'ouverture sera alors intermédiaire.Le Sigma à cela de formidable que vous pourrez avoir l'ouverture incroyablement lumineuse de f/1.8 maximum sur TOUTE la plage de 18mm jusqu'à 35mm de longueur focale. C'est assez extraordinaire.Je l'utilise avec un Canon EOS 70D, donc un milieu de gamme doté d'un capteur APS-C 1.6 fois plus petit qu'un full frame et mes images ont pris une réelle dimension après la prise en main de cet objectif.Vous avez donc la bague de réglage de la distance focale en mm mais aussi celle du diaphragme. Sur cet objectif, le dock dont j'ai parlé plus haut sert uniquement à effectuer le réglage de l'autofocus (correction du back et du front focus) sur 4 valeurs pour les 4 principales distances focales... C'est énorme !!Pour le moment c'st tout ce que je vois à dire... Je complèterai peut être par la suite."
Andrew W.,,Three Stars,works good but hard to focus at 1.8
Lillo,,"Obiettivo fantastico per nitidezza, autofocus inaffidabile","La resa ottica dell'obiettivo è straordinaria, nitido tutti i diaframmi e a tutte le focali, i problemi vengono solo quando si chiude troppo il diaframma e iniziano i problemi di diffrazione, oltre f11, il che è assolutamente normale e non dipende essenzialmente dalla lente, ma dalla fisica.Superiore già a f1,8, a tutte le focali corrispondenti, al Canon EF-S 17-55 F2,8 a 2,8.Il problema è che, sull'esemplare che ho ricevuto, l'autofocus sui miei corpi Canon è assolutamente inaffidabile. Inizialmente il problema era drammatico, si è ridotto un poco dopo aver istallato l'ultimo firmware. Di fatto senza una messa a fuoco affidabile è inutile avere una nitidezza eccellente. Il problema non consiste in un errore costante di back o front focus, ma di una incostanza nella messa a fuoco. Dunque uno scatto può essere a fuoco e i seguenti no, l'errore spesso è macroscopico: la macchina segnala la messa a fuoco corretta con soggetto a 10m e il fuoco invece è a 3 m!!Posta la macchina su cavalletto, con il sensore di fuoco centrale su mira ottica, il fuoco differisce se si fa partire la focheggiatura da infinito o dalla distanza minima di fuoco!Il problema NON si presenta focheggiando in Live View, in questo caso, con una certa lentezza, il fuoco è raggiunto con precisione.Nessun aiuto viene dalla taratura via Sigma Dock USB, perchè non si tratta di slittamenti di fuoco costanti.Ho restituito l'obiettivo perchè non volevo utilizzare un obiettivo AF a mezzo servizio (Live view) o in manuale.Anche se si trattasse di un esemplare difettoso è inconcepibile mettere sul mercato un pezzo evidentemente difettoso, soprattutto considerando il fatto che si tratta della serie top di Sigma (ART). Che controlli di qualità fanno in Sigma?"
Flo,,Vom teuren Traum zum preiswerten Alltagsbegleiter,"Kurz vorweg, damit jeder weiß auf wen er sich hier einlässt: Ich habe vor gut 2 Jahren angefangen mich intensiv mit der Videographie zu befassen, als Einstieg wählte ich damals, nach kurzem Fehlgriff zur a6000, die Nikon D5500. Mein Hauptaufgabenbereich für die Kamera und das Sigma Objektiv liegt vor allem in der Produkt-Photographie, Test- und Review-Aufnahme, cinematischen Produktshots/videos für Unternehmen und außerhalb von Hobby/Beruf bei der Reisefotografie. Natürlich wäre hier Vollformat die erste logische Wahl, doch sind APS-C Kameras deutlich mobiler und Filme werden sowieso im optimal Fall in 35mm gedreht und da kommt der APS-C Sensor am ehesten von der Kompression hin - deshalb auch die Entscheidung langfristig auf APS-C zu setzen, die man mit dem Kauf dieser Linse zwangsläufig trifft.Weil der Text etwas lang werden könnte fangen wir am besten Mal mit einer Gliederung an:-Meine Erfahrungen-Zubehör-Optik & Haptik-Qualität der Bilder-Zusammenfassung & Fazit===Meine Erfahrungen===Das Sigma-Objektiv habe ich jetzt gute 2 Monate im beinahe täglichen Einsatz gehabt, nur wenn der Kamera-Akku geladen werden musste, lag es auf dem Schreibtisch. Ansonsten hatte ich es sowohl im Outdoor- als auch im Studio-Einsatz für die oben erwähnten Zwecke gehabt.Bevor ich den Griff zum 18-35 von Sigma wagte, nutze ich über ein Jahr das 35mm von Nikon, welches im Verhältnis zum Preis mehr als solide Ergebnisse liefert.Nichts desto trotz werden Videos und Photos mit der Zeit langweilig, denn nach dem 100. Shot in 35mm ist der kreative Spielraum ausgereizt. Es musste also eine andere Brennweite her. Doch die Blende von f1.8 sollte auch wieder ein Merkmal des neuen Objektivs werden.Wer etwas nach Linsen für APS-C Kameras schaut wird nicht um diese Art-Linse herumkommen. So war es auch bei mir, nach vielen Überlegungen, nicht zuletzt wegen des nicht all zu günstigen Preises, stand meine Wahl doch fest. Kleiner Tipp noch anbei, wartet ruhig mal ein paar Wochen, dann geht das Objektiv oft von 729 auf 680 (direkt bei Amazon) runter - und fallt nicht auf dubiose Händler rein, die dieses Teil für unter 500€ verkaufen.===Zubehör===Im Lieferumfang findet man neben dem Linsenhalter an sich noch eine hochwertige Tasche, die ich aber nie benutzt habe, einen Objektivdeckel für Mount und Linse, sowie die Gegenlichtblende.Fertig.Achso, Bedienungsanleitung und Garantiezettel gibts noch. Vergesst auf keinen Fall das Objektiv online bei Sigma zu registrieren - gibt 3 Jahre Garantie!Wirklich fertig.===Optik & Haptik===Das Alu-Glas Konstrukt macht optisch ja schon ziemlich was her, natürlich kauft man sich sowas nicht als Statussymbol, wer aber Auftragsarbeiten macht, der braucht auch in der heutigen Zeit, in der eine ""winzige"" Hasselblad 50MP und eine gigantische dynamische Reichweite hat, noch Equipment das beim Kunden nach etwas aussieht. Sollte dieses Objektiv locker schaffen.Die Qualittä ist wirklich perfekt. Das Bajonett (die Andockstelle zur Kamera) ist natürlich komplett aus Metall, es rastet sauber ein und gibt ein stabiles klacken von sich wenn es sitzt.Die Regler für Brennweite und Fokus lassen sich butterweich drehen. Der Fokusregler läuft am Ende über Unendlich und 0,28m hinaus, muss dafür aber wesentlich fester gedreht werden - habt ihr also auch vor damit zu filmen, dann werdet ihr kein Problem damit haben einen Follow-Fokus damit zu benutzen. Die Naheinstellgrenze liegt manuell übrigens bei ca. 10cm.Aber auch im Handbetrieb lässt sich präzise scharf stellen - im Fotomodus oft gar nicht so essentielle, da funktioniert der Autofokus sehr gut - im Video-Modus umso wichtiger, zumindest mit einer Nikon, denn die haben keinen guten Video-Autofokus.Auch der Deckel für die Frontlinse ist sehr hochwertig, während der von Nikon irgendwie bei jedem 3. Versuch einfach abfällt hält der von Sigma bombenfest (durch mein 18-250 kann ich auch versichern, dass sich das nach 2 Jahren aktiver Nutzung nicht ändert).Neben der innenliegenden Fokusskala lässt sich auf der Außenseite nicht mehr viel finden - außer das silberne A das bei Sigma für die Art-Serie steht, also die Linsenserie mit der höchsten Qualität (zumindest im Foto-Bereich).Bei der Haptik sollte aber keines falls auch das Gewicht vergessen werden. Das Sigma wiegt 810 Gramm, viele DSLRs werden selbst mit Akku und Batteriegriff weniger auf die Waage bringen, bedenkt also, dass eure Kamera mitunter sehr unbalanciert werden kann, was den Trage- und Haltekomfort deutlich einschränkt.Benutzt ihr z.B. eine Nikon D500 mit 840 Gramm, dann schleppt ihr 1650 Gramm mit euch rum. Bei meinen Reisen ist dieses Gewicht sowohl im Gepäck als auch beim täglichen Erkunden doch eine ganz schöne Hausnummer. Zumal man ja oft noch einen zweiten Zoom oder einen stärkeren Weitwinkel mit dabei hat.Etwas schade ist allerdings, dass in diesem Gehäuse und bei dem Gewicht kein Bildstabilisator Platz gefunden hat. Klar mit einer Blende von 1.8 kann man leicht auf eine kurze Belichtungszeit gehen. Doch besonders beim Filmen oder wenn man die maximale Schärfe bei einer geschlossenen Blende möchte, dann muss man etwas länger belichten - und dann wäre etwas Support durch die Linse wünschenswert.===Qualität der Bilder===Jetzt der wichtigste und ausschlaggebende Punkt für den Kauf einer 700€ (999€ UVP) Linse.Natürlich schafft es Sigma nicht über die kompletten 18mm hinweg das Niveau von Festbrennweiten zu erreichen - aber das erwartet auch keiner. Festbrennweiten über die komplette Bandbreite hinweg würden sowieso jenseits der 4000€ liegen. Zumal man wahrscheinlich keine Festbrennweite mit 23 oder 31mm finden wird.Die Qualität der Bilder ist aber wirklich tadellos. Zwischen Blende 1.8 und 2.5 sieht man eine immer weiter abnehmende Vignettierung, die bei Blende 2.8 komplett verschwindet. Die Schärfe ist schon bei maximaler Offenblende wirklich beachtlich. Geht man aber runter/rauf bis Blende 4 kriegt man selbst mit einer Einsteiger APS-C Kamera bombastische Ergebnisse.Der einzige Wermutstropfen sind die chromatischen Aberrationen. Fotografiert man bei viel Licht und offener Blende, dann sieht man an harten Linien und Kanten rote und grüne Farbsäume (vergleichbare mit Rot-Cyan-3D Bildern) - diese lassen sich zwar leicht in Lightroom und Co. korrigieren und sind bei variablen Linsen mit dieser Blende so gut wie nicht vermeidbar - bei Videos aber etwas nervig.Selbst Kameras für 300-500€ haben heute sehr gute Sensoren, meist sogar die von ihren größeren Schwestermodellen. Diese Sensoren können mit einer guten Linse deutlich mehr aus sich rausholen als mit den Standard 18-55mm Kit-Objektiven die für 50€ mehr oft direkt in der Box mit dabei sind.Denn jede Einsteiger-DSLR hat mindestens 18 oder mehr Megapixel, das sind 18.000.000 Bildpunkte, die alle mit Licht versorgt werden müssen. Je schlechter dieses Licht, umso schlechter sind auch die Daten die die Bildpunkte weitergeben können. Viele denken sie brauchen eine D5 oder eine XD1 um tolle Ergebnisse zu bekommen, doch selbst diese Kameras können ohne entsprechende Objektive nichts, was eine billig-DLSR nicht auch könnte.Am besten ihr werft mal einen Blick auf das Bild mit dem Netz oder am Fernrohr um die tollen Details sehen zu können - oder auf die Bilder am Obst- und Gemüseladen um zu sehen, wie Fotos mit großen Blenden automatisch viel professioneller wirken.===Zusammenfassung & Fazit===Vergleicht man die Abbildungsleistung über die gesamte Brennweite hinweg mit verschiedenen Festbrennweiten, fällt sofort auf wie nah das Sigma doch an diese herankommt. Dazu spart das Sigma, das trotzdem noch über 800 Gramm wiegt, deutlich an Gewicht und Zeit, denn es ist kein lästiges Wechseln und Umhertragen der Linsen notwendig.Warum ist das Objektiv also jetzt preiswert? Kombiniert man diese Qualität, diese Kompaktheit, diese Abbildungsleistung, 3 Jahre Garantie und das Gefühl beim Fotografieren, dass man die volle Kontrolle über sein Bild hat, das Objektiv einen aber sehr gut dabei unterstützt das zu bekommen was man möchte - dann sind 700€ okay.Man sollte sich diese Linse vielleicht nicht als erstes Objektiv gönnen. Generell sollte man bei Equipment immer erst das nutzen was man hat und damit an seine Grenzen gehen, bevor man wieder in neues Zubehör investiert.Hat man aber seine Grenzen erreicht, ist dieses objektiv wirklich die beste Linse die man für Geld und APS-C Kameras kaufen kann. Ganz klare Kaufempfehlung von mir!"

Prashanth,,"love it.. just buy this awesome lens - Updated, focusing issue","Update Nov-2018.I had to sell this lens due to severe focusing issue. initially thought it was issue with my shoot - but no, I have no problem with other lenses. I also read online this issue is on Canon 80D mostly. Disappointed. Pls dont buy. Now I make sure, even if on expensive side, will only buy L series lens from Canon - they are simply awesome------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay, first thing first, I am a rookie in photography, still trying to learn from internet. I own a canon 80D, with canon 50mm 1.8 and a tamron 70-300.I wanted kind of all purpose lens, little bit wider and good for portraits. About 2 months of research went into this purchase.Just took some test shots, they are awesome, considering these are taken at night at higher ISO. they are very sharp indeed. You'll love the build quality of this piece...I was very skeptical considering it has no IS and read about some focusing issue. No issue with IS at all, you dont need them if you can play around with shutter speed and aperture. Haven't tested auto-focusing thoroughly, will need some time.Yes, its expensive, but quality comes with price. Highly recommend this as replacement to your kit lens. Have a look at the samples, one out of the camera and one with bit of editing in lightroom. judge by yourself...:-)"
SDAYE,,Magnifique image mais problèmes de focus,"Je ne vais pas m'étendre sur les points positifs, beaucoup l'ont fait avant...Ce qui me déçois c'est les problèmes de Front Focus très visibles à ouverture max (1,8).Après quelques recherches j'ai trouvé comment le régler assez rapidement sur mon D7200 mais c'est décevant et il vaut mieux ne pas faire le focus sur un autre point que le centrale --> obligé de prendre des photos avec la méthode focus/recompose mais à 1,8 il faut de la chance pour que la photo soit net (petite zone de netteté).Donc attention à ouverture max, à utiliser que dans des cas particulier et avec la bonne correction (+15 dans mon d7200) sinon c'est que du bonheur.Méthode pour régler rapidement la correction AF consiste à comparer la valeur de focus sur l'objectif entre un focus en modes liveview et et un focus en mode ""viseur"" (appareil immobile). Si la valeur de focus change entre les deux modes c'est qu'il y a un problème et il faut faire des réglages dans le menu de l'appareil."

Ideal für Aufnahmen im Nahbereich mit toller Tiefenschärfe und unglaublichen Details. Einzig stört mich das hohe Gewicht und der doch recht hohe Widerstand am Fokusring."
Ein Kunde,,Sollte schon ab Werk funktionieren,"Zu erst einmal: Das Objektiv fühlt sich gerade in Anbetracht des Preises unglaublich hochwertig an. Alles ist tip-top verarbeitet und wie aus einem Guss. Die Zoom- und Fokus-Ringe laufen langsam und butterweich. Ein versehentliches, ruckartiges Verstellen ist nur schwer möglich - ideal für die Videografie. Aber dafür habe ich mir das Objektiv nicht gekauft. Sondern für das Fotografieren. Kommen wir gleich zum Wesentlichen: Mein Exemplar des Sigma 18-35 hatte in sämtlichen Zoombereichen einen beträchtlichen Back-Fokus. Dieser lag im Telebereich - gemessen am Spyder LensCal - um desaströse 6 cm daneben. Kurzum: Das Objektiv war bei Lieferung hoffnungslos fehlfokussiert und zum Fotografieren nicht zu gebrauchen. In meiner Not habe ich mir das (gar nicht mal so billige) Sigma USB-Dock angeschafft und gehofft damit den Fehlfokus zu korrigieren. Zwar schön, dass diese Selbstanpassung bei Sigma möglich ist, das Einstellen leider einer Sisyphusarbeit gleicht, war es mir aber nicht möglich den Fehlfokus komplett zu korrigieren. Gerade im Weitwinkelbereich ist es sehr schwierig die richtigen Einstellungen über das Sigma USB-Dock einzugeben und alles gleicht mehr einem Raten. Jetzt saß der Fokus oft richtig, aber dann oft auch wieder völlig falsch. So schön das Objektiv auch ist, aber die AF-Leistung überzeugt mich (zumindest bei meinem Exemplar) nicht. Mag sein, dass das Sigma-Werk bessere Justagemöglichkeiten hat, aber ich mag ein nigelnagelneues Exemplar nicht direkt wieder zum Hersteller einschicken. Mag auch sein, dass andere Exemplare deutlich besser sind und meines ein reines Montagsmodell war. Die Bewertung richtet sich daher rein nach meinen Einzelfallerfahrungen."

Patrick,,Wenn der Fokus sitzt - das Schärfte Objektiv der Welt.... leider viel zu selten,"Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,dies ist meine erste Produkt Reszission auf Amazon somit entschuldige ich mich für eine vielleicht nicht perfekte Analyse.Erstmal 6 Sterne an Amazon Objektiv Nachmittags bestellt nächsten Tag geliefert bekommen (Samstags).Schon vorab wurde ich durch andere Rezessionen an den Rand des Wahnsinns getrieben... Wird der Fokus sitzen oder nicht? Ich war schon zuvor im Besitz eines Sigma Objektivs 17-50 2.8 wo der Fokus perfekt war. Auch bei meinen anderen original Canon Objektiven hatte ich bisher nie Probleme.Objektiv ausgepackt und natürlich erstmal von der Wertigkeit und der Haptik beeindruckt... Selten besser gesagt noch nie so ein edles Objektiv gesehen, es hat Freude gemacht es anzufassen... Ich hätte mit Ihm gerne soviel zeit verbracht... Aber es sollte anders kommen...Nachdem sich meine erste Euphorie gelegt hatte und ich mir dann dachte, dass ich damit vielleicht auch mal Fotografieren sollte und nicht nur streicheln kam der Schlag ins Gesicht. Kein einziges meiner Fotos wurde nur im Ansatz scharf - ich hatte schon viel von Front oder Backfokus gelesen aber das war eher ein ""Fokus to Random"". Besser gesagt lag er jedes mal meilen weit davor(30cm-50cm).Meine interne Objektivkorrektur hatte keine Chance dagegen anzukommen. Nach den bekannten Selbstzweifeln wie: 1) Liegt es an meiner Kamera? 2) Liegt es an dem 70D Auto Fokus problem? 3) Sind die Lichtbedingungen falsch?und geschlagenen 5 Stunden später steht fest: Jep das Objektiv ist absolut unbrauchbar. Also den Support von Amazon kontaktiert und die haben mir direkt ein neues Geschickt (Wieder 6+ Sterne an Amazon). Der Fehler wurde Samstag 13:00 bei Amazon gemeldet und mein Paket kam Montag morgen.Neues Objektiv neues Glück. Nachdem ich es auf meine 70D geschraubt hatte habe ich ein paar Testfotos mit dem Traumflieger Testchart gemacht. Und siehe da der Fokus sitzt.... vorerst...Nach ca 100 Bildern in einer Entfernung von 0,3m-1,2m wollte ich dann mal Landschaftsaufnahmen machen. Nach dem 1 Foto wo der Fokus viel zu weit vorne Lag dachte ich, dass es nur eine Fehlfokkusierung war... 50 Bilder später wurde ich eines besseren belehrt.Die Linse ist im Bereich 0,3m-1m gut kalibriert (+5/+5 AF Justage) Aber umso stärker es gegen unendlich geht umso fataler entsteht ein Frontfokus.Diesmal habe ich noch nicht den Amazon Kundenservice bestellt sondern den Sigma USB Dock um das Problem aus der Welt zu schaffen, da der Fokus außer im oo gut sitzt.Nachtrag folgt..."
ilmioalterego,,Nuovi orizzonti fotografici,"Non esiste un obiettivo analogo sulla Terra. Di fatto, se in possesso di un corpo macchina sufficientemente robusto ad alti ISO (D3300, D5300, D7100 per esempio), pressochè annulla le differenze (a parte la lunghezza focale minore) rispetto ad un'accoppiata FX e 24-70mm.La spedizione: perfetta, in anticipo, come da tradizione AmazonIl prodotto: la qualità c'è, si vede e si sente; al primo contatto si percepisce il peso e la fattura in materiali destinati a durare, con ghiere senza gioco e precisissime nella rotazione, un unico comando a sinistra per lo switch AF/MF, e la flangia portafiltri in plastica (il resto è tutto in TSC e metallo). Il paraluce (in dotazione) si innesta a rotazione. Diametro filtri 72mmLa qualità ottica: la vera sua peculiarità, oltre alla luminosità eccezionale (e costante su tutta la lunghezza focale), è la nitidezza impressionante a f1.8. Di fatto permette di scattare a mano libera di notte. Sostituisce in un solo colpo 3 fissi, 24 28 e 35mm. Il bokeh è molto piacevole, il controluce evidenzia una buona resistenza ai flares, i raggi di sole, grazie al diaframma a 9 lamelle, sono ben riprodotti (da f11 in su)Conclusioni: a questo prezzo è un furto, sostituire il 18-55 di serie con questo e un 50 f1.8 fisso permette di ottenere il meglio da sensori, come gli ultimi che equipaggiano le entry-level Nikon, che esigono lenti di qualità, e di cambiare radicalmente il proprio modo di fotografare. La lunghezza focale relativamente ridotta richiede la consapevolezza dell'utilizzo che se ne andrà a fare (18 mm sono troppi per paesaggio e 35 troppo pochi per ritratto). Unito ad un grandangolo spinto e a un fisso da 50 o 85 mm permette di avere un corredo fotografico per DX a prova di ripensamenti per parecchio tempo. Il suo utilizzo ideale resta comunque il reportage, matrimoni, eventi, street photography, e fotografia di viaggio. Alcuni esemplari sono afflitti da fenomeni di front/back focus, risolvibili rapidamente mediante il dock USB che Sigma vende a parte e con cui il 18-35 è pienamente compatibile (un piccolo investimento ulteriore per rendere l'obiettivo perfetto e per aggiornarne il firmware). Altro particolare, lo squilibrio non indifferente su corpi macchina piccoli come D3x00 richiede quantomeno l'utilizzo di un battery pack, più bilanciato invece su D7100 e D300.Provato su Nikon D3100 per circa 1500 scatti in 15 giorni"
Tomas,,soft on right side - bad copy?,After reading a lot of good reviews and browsing other forums I decide to upgrade my kit. I needed something much sharper and low light capable than my 28-135 3.5-5.6. After smooth delivery I start running some sharpness tests. I was really disappointed with results. Turn out that whole right side of every picture on every aperture is very soft. Kit lens 18-55 in the same test was much sharper. Unfortunately I had to send it back. Probably bad copy but the only reason I'm writing this review is to warn everyone who is planing to buy it at the moment since after my purchase amazon went out of stock and now after I return it they have 1 left. I assume that is probably one I received.
dagoe,,Wenn der Fokus passt ist es super,"Nachdem ich bereits das Sigma 17-70 mm f2,8-4,0 besitze und sehr zufrieden bin, habe ich mir das Sigma 18-35mm F1,8 DC geholt, um eine bessere Bildqualität und eine höhere Lichtstärke zu bekommen.Das erste Objektiv welches geliefert wurde hatte einen starken Frontfokus über die gesamte Brennweite. Es war nicht möglich auch nur ein scharfes Bild hinzubekommen. Das Bild war immer vor dem eigentlichen Fokuspunkt scharf. Über die Kamerainterne Objektiveinstellung an der 80D konnte ich es halbwegs einstellen und einige der Bilder waren gestochen scharf. Das hilft mir an der 450D allerdings nicht weiter da diese keine Kamerainterne Verstellmöglichkeit hat. Also habe ich das Objektiv zurückgesendet und ein neues im Austausch bekommen.Das zweite Objektiv hat ebenfalls einen starken Frontfokus und ich habe das Objektiv erneut austauschen lassen.Das dritte Objektiv hat nur einen mittleren Frontfokus. Ich habe mir nun den Sigma Dock gekauft und konnte das Objektiv einstellen. Insgesamt habe ich dafür ca. 5 Std. benötigt, da es keine ordentliche Anleitung von Sigma für den Testaufbau gibt. Der Fokus sitzt jetzt in ca. 90% der Fälle und bei einigen unscharfen Bilder war es garantiert auch ein Anwenderfehler.Verarbeitung ist 1a und an das Gewicht gewöhnt man sich. Es ist auch nur 230g schwerer als mein UWW Tokina 11-16 F2.8. Durch die lange Bauart liegt es gut in der Hand Fokusring und Zoomring laufen butterweich. Die Bilder sind bei Offenblende sehr gut und scharf. Leicht abgeblendet werden die Bilder knackscharf. Der Unterschied fällt aber wahrscheinlich nur in der 100% Ansicht auf.,Fazit: Ein Topobjektiv wenn es ab Werk funktioniert oder eingestellt wird. Ich ziehe 2 Punkte ab da bei mir ab Werk 3 von 3 Objektiven unscharf waren. Die Einstellung mit dem Dock ist aufwendig und das Dock muss auch separat gekauft werden. Es ist mir zwar bekannt, dass ich das Objektiv zu Sigma senden kann, um es einstellen zu lassen, aber bei einem Neuartikel kann das nicht die Lösung sein. Man wird das Gefühl nicht los, dass Sigma hier bei der Qualitätssicherung spart. Das es anders geht beweist das Sigma mit 17-70 (Gekauft 2014) welches an beiden Kameras einwandfrei funktioniert.Hier auch ein Dank an die anderen Rezensionen. Ich wusste, dass ich mit etwas Mühe ein tolles Objektiv bekomme und habe daher nicht schon nach dem zweiten Objektiv aufgegeben.Nachtrag Dezember 2016:Im Urlaub habe ich viele unscharfe Bilder bei Offenblende und einem Motivabstand Abstand von 2-4 Metern geschossen. Ich habe mich dann entschlossen das Objektiv und die Kamera zu Sigma zu senden um es einstellen zu lassen.Der Fokus sitzt jetzt fast immer und ich kann bedenkenlos auch 4 Sterne vergeben. Das Objektiv hätte 5 Sterne verdient wenn es so ab Werk gekommen wäre."
Mattia Angius,,"Lente ottima per foto, discreta per video.","Ho acquistato questa lente come mio primo obiettivo alternativo al classico 18-55 dopo aver valutato tantissime opzioni ed aver guardato un centinaio di confronti e recensioni su internet. Che dire, la qualità in foto è davvero sbalorditiva, SIGMA ha fatto un lavoro egregio, è un obiettivo molto pesante, quasi 1kg, dovuto alla costruzione interamente in metallo, le ghiere sono in una gomma di ottima qualità.Purtroppo devo togliere la quinta stella perchè provando a fare qualche video ci si rende subito conto che l'autofocus è veramente moolto lento e anche molto rumoroso, cosa che non risulta così fastidiosa durante gli scatti normali.In sostanza se cercate una lente per video forse dovreste guardare qualcos'altro (nulla da togliere alla resa grafica che rimane altissima anche in video) ."
charles bouchard,,Five Stars,Very good lens
Kamil Mastela,,Simply Amazing!,"I'm just getting into photography and I still have a lot to learn but I can still get some amazing shots with this lens. This lens is just what I needed after getting Nikkor 50mm F1.8 as my first lens. I use it on Nikon D5100. So far I can't say a bad word about this lens. If you can afford it, simply BUY IT! :)"
Pakko,,これは楽しい！,広角寄りの標準ズームレンズが、開放F1.8だとこんなに楽しいなんて！！きちんとピントを合わせられれば、極上の写りが得られます。少々重いとか、手振れ補正が欲しいとか、そんなことは言いっこなし。この写りがこの価格で手に入ることを、素直に喜びましょう。
Bruno Canova,,wow,"Montato sulla mia D7200 fa egregiamente il proprio dovere. Nitidezza chirurgica e luminosità inusitata lo rendono decisamente versatile e inducono a sperimentare. Ovviamente si tratta pur sempre di un range di focali ridotto ma le sue caratteristiche lo rendono paragonabile a una serie di ottiche fisse che va dal 18 al 35 (bassissima distorsione, ridotta aberrazione cromatica e vignettatura trascurabile a tutte le aperture e le focali). Ovviamente è una lente da APSC (nel mio caso le focali vanno moltiplicate per 1,5 e corrispondono a un 24-52 che, croppato per scatti non eccessivamente esigenti,diventa sostanzialmente un 70mm). La mancanza di uno stabilizzatore ottico, viste le focali, si sente solo utilizzando tempi decisamente lunghi ma probabilmente è necessaria per ottenere la luminosità e la qualità ottica voluta mantenendo questo prezzo, il che rende il tutto decisamente accettabile."
meri,,Ottima lente ma autofocus non tarato bene,"Ho preso questa lente fantastica, caratteristiche uniche. Però quella che mi è arrivata dopo i primi test aveva un forte problema di messa a fuoco. Dopo alcune ore di taratura con al base usb che già avevo sono riuscito ad arginare il problema ed usarla in alcuni servizi, ma praticamente la taratura è al limite della scala possibile, quindi ho preferito restituirla perchè se in futuro dovesse stararsi ulteriormente non potrei compensare ancora. Tarare la lente con al base è veramente difficile perchè essendo uno zoom devi tarare per un gran numero di focali per almeno 3 distanze, quindi ci vuole tanto tempo."
Jacinto,,Gran objetivo (y pesado).,"No pongo 5 estrellas porque es muy pesado. Viajar con él es incómodo. Sobre el resto, dá lo que promete."
Felinux,,Merita 6 stelle!,"Obiettivo di rango e lignaggio non appartenenti alla sua fascia di prezzo.Di recensioni online che ne diaminano ogni particolare ce ne sono a iosa, tutte concordi nel definirlo estremamente prestante, non posso che esserne allineato anche io aggiungendo che anche il piacere d'uso non è da meno.Un vero istantclassic per i formati ridotti."
Jake Ogden,,HIDEOUSLY inaccurate AF,"HIDEOUSLY inaccurate AF. I had two of these lenses and neither worked correctly, I even sent one to Sigma HQ to get calibrated and it did nothing. If you aren't going to use it in AF then this lens is awesome. It's beautifully sharp when it hits the focus and for film it is beautiful. However if you want to use this for still photography work then be warned it will miss the focus point 80% of the time. Mine have now been sent back and I just got a 35mm 1.8 from nikon for £400 less."
Streamer,,Nicht schlecht für ein Sigma...,"Als VDSLR Filmer meine Erfahrungen:So richtig glücklich war ich bisher nie, wenn ich mal ein Sigma in die Hände bekam. Lieber etwas mehr Geld ausgeben und was Solides und kaufen, so jedenfalls dachte ich immer.Dieses Objektiv aber ist nicht vergleichbar mit bisherigen Sigma Objektiven.Sehr lichtstark und das durchgehend. Keinerlei Ramping im Zoom End Bereich, Kein Focus Pumpen !Allein diese drei Kriterien sind ein Kaufargument. Der Preis ist unschlagbar und man macht nichts nur falsch bei dem Preis, nein man erhält ne Top Linse. Das Gehäuse aus Metall, solide verarbeitet, Zoom und Focus laufen geschmeidig und vermitteln einen guten Eindruck für den Schärfepunkt.An einer BMCC, 7D und C300 machte die Linse TOP Bilder. Bei offener Blende hat sie das Bokeh einer 5D mit F2.8.Für APS-C bzw. S35mm Sensoren hat das Sigma eine gute Range von Weitwinkel 18mm, und dabei kaum zu merkende Verzeichnung (Tonne) bis zu einem 35mm was ne schöne Universal Brennweite ist und natürlich ohne zuverzeichnen.Ein kurzesTestvideo mit dem Sigma an einer BMCC Kamera (S25mm) habe ich für Interessierte hier eingestellt. [...]Was ich mir von Sigma wünsche, ist diese Qualität, diese Lichtstärke in weiteren Zoom Objektiven umzusetzen.Einen kurzen Videotest der Optik an einer BMCC finden Sie hier [...]"
Paul,,SIGMA toujours au TOP !,"SIGMA a fait un excellent travail avec cet objectif de 18-35mm en ouverture fixe (f/1,8) classé ""ART"", en l'utilisant on sait pourquoi.Un ""bokeh""-flou d'arrière plan parfait, je recommande grandement !"
ロストマン,,いいけど重い,期待通り素晴らしいレンズだったけど、マジで重いです。これ一本でかなりつかい勝手は良いがいかんせん重くて心が折れそう。重くてもいいと言う強い覚悟が必要なレンズ
D.V.,,AF-Tombola,"Mein lang ersehnter Traum ist ganz schnell geplatzt. Mein Exemplar geht zurück.Die Verarbeitung top, Auflösung bis f5,6 super, Bokeh die feinste Sahne!Scharfstellen aber bitte nur manuell oder im Live-View, Autofokus war trotz größter Sorgfalt nicht durchgängig einzustellen.Bei f1,8 mit AF nicht zu gebrauchen, geringste Abweichungen führen hier bereits zum Ausschuss ."
Autohaus Gemünden GmbH,,ziemlich ziemlich gut! aber…,"man muss den Sigma USB-Dock dazu kaufen.Wenn man dann sich die Zeit nimmt und das Objektiv nach exakten Abstand, niedrigste ISO und Blendenzahl geschätzte 1h justiert kommt ein richtig gutes Ergebnis in allen Brennweiten heraus. Super scharf, danach total treffsicher und in keinster Weise mehr ein Problem mit der EOS 80D.Ohne USB Adapter hat man nur die Möglichkeit die kleinste und höchste Brennweite einzurechnen in der eigenen Firmware der Kamera. Auch geht ein Foto machen, danach nachjustieren in der Firmware der Kamera (C.Fn II: Autofokus und dort mit 2:Abst. pro Objektiv), aber schöner mit dem USB Dock von Sigma fest in das Objektiv schreiben.Für Leute mit einfacheren Firmware Versionen wie z.B. EOS 77D und 800D macht es um einiges mehr Arbeit die richtigen Daten zu errechnen da hier schlicht das Menu C.Fn II: Autofokus in der Kamera eingespart wurde und dieses Menu ist einfach genial um sehr viele Objektive anzupassen, denn fast keins passt mehr 100%. Außer natürlich Canons eigene Objektive.hier mal noch meine Daten als Bild wobei ich mir vorstellen kann, dass eine andere EOS 80D leicht abweicht."
Flavio85,,Miglior obiettivo per apsc mai creato,"Una lama.... Nitidezza estrema già a 1.8 e senza aberrazioni o distorsioni.un Opera d'arte fatta obiettivo... Sono riuscito ad ottenere scatti pazzeschi, é come avere 4 ottiche fisse in una. Ho una d7200 e questo obiettivo ormai non lo tolgo più... Ci faccio di tutto. Ho chiuso il mio corredo con un sigma 70_200 2.8 perché in questo modo ho coperto un po' tutte le focali, ma ho provato il 50_100 sempre 1.8 ed é anche lui incredibile... Ma a parità di peso ho preferito il 70 200 Tralaltro stabilizzato. Lo consiglio a tutti quelli che hanno un apsc farete un salto di qualità immenso. Conservate I soldini e compratelo perché dopo di questo non tornerete indietro. Fidatevi"
LH,,Astrofotografie,"Obwohl ich schon mit unempfindlicheren Objektiven schon einige Timelapse Videos machen konnte, verspreche ich mit von der Lichtstärke 1,8 sehr viel. Durch die große Blendenöffnung kann in kurzer Zeit sehr viel Licht einfallen, was Sterne doch eher als Punkte anstatt kleinen Strichen aufnimmt. Leider hat mir das Wetter einen Strich durch die Rechnung gemacht und ich konnte nur Tagesaufnahmen machen. Selbst die waren sehr scharf, die Funktion der Objektives ist einwandfrei, der Fokus lautlos und schnell.Die Qualität und die Haptik ist top."
klausd,,Bello ma non per C100,"Comprato per uso esclusivo su C100+Dual Pixel dopo che Sigma ha rilasciato il nuovo firmware, dal momento che con il firmware 1.0 metteva a fuoco solo a f/1.8. Il problema è che dopo l'aggiornamento l' AF è decisamente peggiorato, infatti in condizioni di scarsa luminosità il dual pixel AF comincia a fare un ping-pong di front e back focusing che spesso non trova fine nemmeno se si inquadra un soggetto con notevole contrasto. Questo succede a tutte le aperture, compreso f/1.8, mentre prima dell'aggiornamento avevo il DAF solo a 1.8 ma almeno funzionava egregiamente, anche con pochissima luce. Purtroppo non è possibile fare il downgrade del firmware con il Sigma Dock. Sul web sembrano essere tutti felici e contenti dell'aggiornamento, perché sicuramente non avranno notato differenze per fare quei video test schifi che non servono a niente, ma per uso professionale questo è un problema compromettente. Per il resto l'ottica è ottima, nitidezza, qualità costruttiva e bla bla... il resto sapete tutto...."

martin günther,,Unglaublich scharf,"Als ich das erste Mal von diesem Objektiv gelesen habe, konnte ich es gar nicht richtig glauben: eine Brennweite von 18 bis 35 mm bei konstanter Offenblende von 1.8?! Nachdem ich einige Testberichte gelesen hatte, konnte ich es kaum erwarten das Objektiv selbst zu testen. Was soll ich sagen – ich bin begeistert!Das Objektiv hat eine unglaublich hohe Abbildungsleistung. Bereits bei Offenblende ist es schärfer als so manche Festbrennweite und das als Zoomobjektiv. Für Crop-Kameras ergeben sich mit diesem Objektiv völlig neue Möglichkeiten, die vorher so nur mit Vollformatkameras und wesentlich teureren Objektiven realisiert werden konnten. Das Freistellen von Motiven macht mit diesem Objektiv einfach unglaublich viel Spaß.Entgegen einiger Rezensionen hier kann ich mich keineswegs über Probleme mit dem Autofokus beschweren, obwohl das exakte Fokussieren bei Offenblende selbstverständlich anspruchsvoll ist – der Schärfebereich ist einfach wahnsinnig klein.PRO- Bildqualität, das Objektiv ist das schärfste mit dem ich jemals fotografiert habe- Offenblende 1.8 über gesamten Brennweitenbereich- Autofokus – schnell, leise und treffsicher- häufig nicht erwähnt: Naheinstellgrenze von 28 cm!- Verarbeitung, das Objektiv fühlt sich sehr hochwertig an, die gummierten Ringe für Zoom und Fokus lassen sich butterweich und mit angenehmen Widerstand drehenCONTRA- Größe und Gewicht, für eine solche Abbildungsleistung benötigt an natürlich einiges an Glas und das macht sich an einer kleinen Kamera wie meiner Nikon D5500 bemerkbar- eingeschränkter Brennweitenbereich, mit 18-35 mm ist natürlich nur ein relativ kleiner Bereich abgedeckt, dafür ersetzt man aber gleich mehrere Festbrennweiten und übertrifft diese z.T. in der Qualität- anspruchsvolle Handhabung, bei Offenblende ist die Tiefenschärfe so gering, dass man als ungeübter Fotograf viel Ausschuss produziertFazitSchon nach kurzer Zeit ist das SIGMA 18-35 ART zu meinem absoluten Lieblingsobjektiv geworden. Wer ein wirklich lichtstarkes Zoomobjektiv für seine APS-C Kamera sucht und Wert auf hervorragende Abbildungsleistung legt, kommt an diesem Objektiv nicht vorbei! Ich kann es jedenfalls vorbehaltlos empfehlen. Für mich ist dieses Objektiv ein weiterer Grund, nicht auf Vollformat umzusteigen."

Torsten,,Einfach nur klasse!,"Hab lange nach einem passenden und adäquaten Objektiv zu meiner D7100 für schlechtere Lichtverhältnisse gesucht. Im UWW-Bereich bin ich aktuell mit dem Tokina 11-16/2.8 sehr zufrieden, aber der Brennweitenbereich ist natürlich relativ eng. Das Sigma bot sich da fast schon als sinnvolle Ergänzung im gemäßigten Weitwinkelbereich an. Obwohl ich zunächst nicht sicher war, ob mir nach oben doch ein paar Millimeter fehlen würden, da ich vom Tamron 17-50/2.8 umsteigen wollte. Aber nach ein paar Wochen intensiver Nutzung kann ich sagen, dass sie mir nicht wirklich fehlen, greife dann eher zum Nikon 50/1.8.Aber jetzt mehr zum Sigma: Es bietet als Zoom erstmal eine zur Zeit sonst nicht erreichbare, sehr gute Lichtstärke und ist dabei sogar schon bei Offenblende sehr scharf. Als Beispiel hab ich ein Bild des Kölner Musical Domes hochgeladen, welches ich bei ISO 500 aus der Hand aufgenommen habe.Überhaupt ist die Schärfe überaus beeindruckend, es sind selbst kleinste Details sehr schön zu erkennen und die 24MP der 7100 werden sehr gut genutzt. Als Beispiel habe ich dazu ein Bild der Kranhäuser, ebenfalls aus der Hand, hochgeladen.Aufnahmen auf Stativ von nächtlichen Skylines werden zum Genuss und ich freue jedesmal auf die dabei entstehenden Ergebnisse.Kann das Objektiv jedem empfehlen, der was sucht um detailreich und auch bei schlechten Lichtverhältnissen brauchbare Bilder aus der Hand aufzunehmen. Es macht immer wieder extrem viel Spaß mit der Kombi aus D7100 und 18-35 auf Motivjagd zu gehen."
gaucho,,Wanderpokal erhalten,"Nachdem ich für meine Sony Alpha das Sigma 60mm bei Amazon gekauft hatte und total begeistert war, habe ich für meine Nikon D7100 das Sigma 18-35 F1.8 gekauft. Leider habe ich ein Wanderpokal erhalten! Packung war öfters aufgemacht worden. Frontfokus ohne Ende. 3 Stunden rumprobiert. Kamera auf Stativ, mit Libelle ausgerichtet mehrere Tests, Vernichtend. Und das bei einem Objektiv das € 750,00 kostet und sich dann auch noch Art nennt. Haben die bei Sigma keine Qualitätskontrolle ??? Dabei wäre das Objektiv wirklich gut. Habe Aufnahmen mit Live view und die Schärfe manuell eingestellt und wirklich gute scharfe Bilder erhalten. Aber ich habe keine Lust ein nagelneues Objektiv an Sigma zu schicken für eine Reparatur. Und die Art von Amazon solange ein Objektiv zu verschicken bis ein Dummi gefunden wird ist auch sehr Ärgerlich."
Greg,,Problème d'autofocus,Deuxième objectif renvoyé pour le même probleme:problème d'auto focus .Le problème vient vraiment de l'objectif et non du boîtier car mes autres objectifs n'ont pas ce problème.Ce pb de front focus semble être fréquent sur cet objectif.
Hans7,,"Obiettivo eccezionale dal lato meccanico e dal lato ottico, ma purtroppo la messa a fuoco ė una lotteria","Sono stato fortunato di aver comprato da Amazon, che mi ha permesso di restituire il prodotto. Ho una Canon Eos 7d che con altri obiettivi non ha mai dato problemi. Con questo Sigma invece non c'era verso. Provato a scegliere diverse modalitá autofocus, diaframmi diversi su dieci fotografie me ne metteva a fuoco una. Provato con treppiede, niente da fare. Cercato in internet delle soluzioni oppure workaround, alle fine ho rinunciato. Chi ha provato per ore a calibrare con la docking station di sigma non ė riuscito a far funzionare l'autofocus, anche l'ultimo firmware non ha risolto il problema. Se cercate troverete, che ci sono problemi non solo con Canon, ma anche con Pentax, Sony, Nikon. Sarebbe un obiettivo veramente eccezionale, se non avesse questo difetto. In un forum di amici Pentax hanno addirittura provato 7 esemplari che avevano lo stesso difetto che ho trovato io. Peccato! Ho ritornato questo prodotto campione del mondo, che purtroppo ha una pecca."
Markus Ebel,,Autofocus Probleme bein ersten Model,"+ Hammer Verarbeitung+ Optik, sieht einfach genial aus+ perfekt für SLR Video auch bei wenig Licht oder in Räumen- Ab­bil­dungs­leis­tung ist nicht wie beschrieben. Im vergelich zum Canon 15-85mm IS USM (was diesen Bereich ebenfalls abdeckt) bei Blende 4 und steigend hat es deutiche Schärfeprobleme. Das Canon ist um Welten schärfer!- AF Probleme!! 5 mal den gleichen Punkt focusiert, 5 unterschiedliche Punkte wurden tatsächlich anfocusiert.Ich musste es leider zurückschicken. Ausschlaggebend waren die AF Probleme. Nur zum Filmen war es mir zu teuer, hier fallen die AF probleme auch nicht so auf.Jetzt nach etwa 8 Monaten habe ich mir das Objektiv ein 2. mal zugelegt. Jetzt ist alles Prima. Ich arbeite aber bei schwachem Licht nicht über den Sucher, nur über die Live View.In kombination mit der 70d Arbeitet das Objektiv harmionisch. Es gibt selten unschärfe Ausschuss. Für den Sucherbasierenden Autofocus hat es gereicht über die interne AF Korrektur eine sehr zufriedenstellende Trefferquote zu erzielen. Bei zu dunkler Umgebung findet der Sucherbaasierende AF nicht treffsicher (zumindest bei der EOS 70d die ich habe). Ich denke es ist systembedingt, meine alte EOS 350d habe ich bei dunkler Umgebung auch nicht besser Trefferquote in Erinnerung. Mit dem 18-135STM bei Dämmerung verglichen ist die Ausbeute besser aber auch keine 100% mehr.Aktuelles Fazit, für mich absolut perfekt, wenn der Sucherbasierende AF noch ein Tick näher, vergleichbar dem 18-135STM von der Trefferquote bei Dämmerlicht wäre gäbe ich 5 Sterne. Daher für mich mit der 70d Dunkel = Live View."

Ronald,,Lichtstark und scharf,"Eigentlich kein großer Zoom-Fan, habe ich mich doch für dieses lichtstarke Objektiv entschieden, nachdem ich unendlich viel Material im Netz gewälzt hatte. Dieser Bereich an einer Crop-Kamera von umgerechnet etwa 28 bis 50mm Kleinbild gleichzeitig mit einer Lichtstärke von 1.8 zu kombinieren schien mir fast wie die eierlegende Wollmilchsau zu sein. Manchmal braucht es neben meiner voll manuellen M9 auch den (schnellen) Autofokus und dann ist mir die gewohnte Freistellung, die mir die Leica samt Objektiven bietet auch am Crop ziemlich wichtig. Vorneweg gesagt: es funktioniert, selbst in diesem Brennweitenbereich. Man kann mit diesem Objektiv ausreichend freistellen. Es fehlt ein wenig dieser typische 3D-Touch, den ich an meinen Zeiss-Linsen so liebe. Dennoch bin ich mit den Ergebnissen an meiner kleinen Canon 650D recht zufrieden. Offenblendig ist das Sigma ein wenig weich und das Bokeh generell unruhig. Die Schärfe in der Mitte ist jedoch OK, man kann mit wenig Nachhilfe in Lightroom, also unter Nutzung des Rohdatenformats noch eine Menge aus den Bildern herausholen. Ich blende in der Regel auf 2.5 bis 3.2 ab, wenn es mir um die Freistellung geht. Dann sind die Ergebnisse im anvisierten Bereich messerscharf. In der Landschaftsfotografie braucht es ohnehin Blenden ab 8, dann ist das Sigma (wie ohnehin fast jede andere moderne Linse) untadlig. Porträts kann man fotografieren, obwohl diese Brennweite dafür eher nicht geeignet ist. Ich blende dann aber auch leicht ab, ansonsten besteht die Gefahr, das man bei einer nicht völligem planen Gesichtshaltung des Models z. B. nur ein Auge scharf bekommt und der Rest des Kopfes passt nicht. Die Verzeichnungen- vor allem im Nahbereich zwischen 18 und 24mm halten sich im Rahmen, mir sind sie bislang noch nicht allzu negativ aufgefallen. Ein Riesen-Nachteil- aber das ist eben Physik und nicht zu ändern- ist das Gewicht und die Größe des Objektivs. Man schleppt eben fast ein ganzes Kilo zusätzlich mit sich herum. Allerdings rechtfertigen die Ergebnisse, und das man sich einige Festbrennweiten spart, durchaus die Plackerei. Gut auch das Sigma eine Gegenlichtblende mitliefert, was in der Fotobranche nicht allgemein üblich ist."
gery993,,Tolles Objektiv mit Mängel bei der Qualitätskontrolle,"Über das Objektiv und seine Leistung ist schon alles geschrieben worden, es ist wirklich gut.Was offensichtlich bei Sigma nicht funktioniert, ist eine ordentliche Justierung in der Produktion.Ich habe 5 Lieferungen gebraucht, um 2 brauchbare (1 Weihnachtsgeschenk) Optiken zu behalten.Bei dem Preis sollte das nicht passieren!Weil Amazon die Reklamationen für den Hersteller unbürokratisch abgewickelt hat, ziehe ich nur für meine Mühe einen Stern ab."

Das Objektiv ""passt"" von Größe und Gewicht gut an die EOS 60D und ist, wie das ähnlich große/wuchtige 28-75, angenehm balanciert zumindest für mich (190cm, Sportschütze/Ordonanz)Sigma hat hier einen netten FB Killer gebaut der locker 3-4FBs ersetzt (20/24/28/30/35) und dann im Endeffekt günstiger und leichter ist. Es passt gut zwischen mein UWW (10-24) und Standardzoom (28-75) jeweils mit etwas Überlappung so das ein ""wechselfauler"" Betreib machbar ist.Bonus für die kleinen ""dran gedacht"" Elemente wie die gepolsterte Objektivtasche mit Gürtelschlaufe so das man den ""Brocken"" ggf. auch mal ans Koppel hängen kann."
Amazon Customer,,Sony,An der Sony a77 ist der AF langsam und absolut unzuverlässig.Die Bildqualität ist super.Ein Nachbessern ist unbedingt erforderlich.
Juan Moro,,Excelente calidad,"Tuve varios objetivos Sigma profesionales hace años y quedé muy desencantado con la calidad. He de confesar que han mejorado una barbaridad. La calidad óptica es excelente. Lo uso para grabar video a 4K. El único problema es que el filtro es de 72mm. Habría agradecido un diámetro de 77mm, conforme al estándar de ópticas profesionales. Le he puesto un adaptador 72mm-77mm para poder usar un filtro neutro variable, pero claro, el parasol que venía con el objetivo ahora ya no pasa. Dicho esto, no deja de ser un excelente objetivo, y vale mucho más de lo que cuesta."

Mr. R. SARGENT,,Nice Detailed Images!,"Cracking lens, obviously depends what camera body you put it on but the image quality is extremely detailed! Especially in the far corners. The focus ring is accurate and just about has the right amount of resistance! I love the internal zoom, something that is quite scarce on canon lenses.This is an APS-C lens, however it could probably be used on a full frame camera body too!"

気持ちは放浪者,,じっくり腰をすえて撮影するには良いレンズ,F値開放でも周辺部の像の流れと、解像度の低下が少ないことは特質すべき点です。キャノンユーザーでは、ズームリングの方向が逆ですので、純正ズームレンズと併用すると、とっさのズーム操作で錯覚を起こしますが、各社マウント共通の組立ラインにより、コストを抑えていますのでこの点は仕方がありません。AFで合焦と認識する範囲が広く、とっさのチャンスに一度の合焦で撮影すると高い確率でピントを外します。何度かフォーカシング（シャッターの半押し）を繰り返すと合焦精度が上がってきますので、AF位置がずれているわけではないようです。じっくり落ち着いて撮影する風景撮影などには良いレンズだと思います。《追記》さらに使っていて分かってきた部分について追記させていただきます。詳細に測定してみると、やはり相応のフォーカスのズレがありました。中間焦点距離や被写体までの距離によってもバラつきがありますので、比例的な傾向を前提に補正するボディ側のAFマイクロアジャストメント（Canonの場合）では、調整に限界があります。やはり、USB DOCKは必須ですね。調整には、それなりに根気と勘が必要ですが、ファームウエアの更新にも利用できますので、お持ちでない方は一緒に購入をお勧めします。このレンズのAF撮影では、できるだけ狭い測距エリア（1点スポットがベスト）を指定するのが正確なフォーカスのコツです。全面自動選択AFだと、かなりテキトーに合焦してしまいますので、高い確率でどこにもピンのない画になります。（Canonの場合の傾向ですので、他のメーカーでも同様なのかはわかりません。）《さらに追記》それほどハードな使用をしているわけではありませんが、ズームリングの焦点距離表示が消えてきました。本体の塗装は強そうですが、文字表示は擦れに弱いようです。持ち運ぶ時は、バッグ内で他の機材と擦れ合わないように、レンズケースに収納しておいた方が良いと思います。
Client d'Amazon,,"Parfait, mais ..","Cet objectif n'a plus rien à prouver.De qualité optique irréprochable, piqué extraordinaire. Aucun problème de front/back focus comme annoncé sur certains modèles.Certes, pas le prix le moins cher d'Internet, mais la livraison premium est très efficace.La dessus justement, j'enlève une étoile : Mr le livreur, pensez-vous qu'il est judicieux de mettre l'objectif dans la boite aux lettres par -4°C, alors que j'étais chez moi et qu'il aurait simplement fallu sonner pour que je récupère mon colis ? Résultat : le cache avant s'est contracté avec le froid, impossible de l'enlever au déballage, obligé d'attendre que l'objectif se mette à température ambiante. Frustrant lorsqu'on commande un objectif à 700€ et qu'on le reçoit, et qu'on soit obligé de le regarder, sans pouvoir l'essayer. Je trouve ça moyen. (Même si maintenant il fonctionne parfaitement)"
Enrique Costa,,Carrozzeria di Ferrari e motore di furgona,"Non voglio parlare delle qualità ottiche, sono d'accordo di che sono molto buoni (Ecco perché io non metto una stella). Io voglio parlare di frustrazione e l'impotenza che ho sentito per ordinare questo prodotto in due volte (il secondo in sostituzione del primo) e aver rizevuto due obiettivi con problemi di autofocus. Ora sono in fase di rimborso.Ho provato con diverse telecamere (Nikon D60, Nikon D90, Nikon 7200) e il risultato è sempre lo stesso immagini sfocate. Il autofocus non funziona, ma il foco manuale è sorprendentemente buono. Imagini comparative in MF e AF provan il problema.Quindi lenti sono tutte sbagliate? Non la penso così. Sembra che il dipartimento qualità di Sigma è poco professionale.Lo migliori: Il trattamento squisito di il personale di Amazon.itLo peggio: La frustrazione e l'impotenza e l'inconveniente dell'acquisto fallito, il mio primo acquisito in Amazon.it.

Delivery is pretty fast and the packaging is very tight so that lens keeps safe during Transaction.Here are the Pros & Cons of the lens:A: Pros:1) Build quality is great. It does not feel cheap by any mean.2) Constant F/1.8 Aperture3) Great for low light film making and photography4) 3in1 Prime lens! (in my opinion)4) Lens is very sharp. Produce awesome images.5) Comes with 2 Year Sigma warrantyB: Cons:1) This lens is hell expensive. You can't deny the fact that this lens is pretty expensive at 60K Indian Ruppe!2) This lens is very heavy! trust me!3) The zoom ring is pretty tight.

Francesco,,Attenzione ad usarlo con Canon 80D!!!,"Spinto da tantissime opinioni positive su questo obiettivo, decido di acquistarlo per utilizzarlo con la mia canon 80d. Subito mi accorgo che qualcosa non va: foto non nitidissime e MAG molto imprecisa. Allora Inizio a fare dei test sfruttando il software FOCAL per la calibrazione dell'obiettivo. Risultati: +14 a 18mm e addirittura +33 a 35mm. Mi sono messo le mani in testa! Faccio delle ricerche su internet per capire se è un problema di incompatibilà non dichiarato oppure un prodotto sfigato capitato nelle mie mani. La prima opzione è quella giusta e capisco che non sono l'unico a lamentarsi di questa accoppiata: praticamente il sigma art non va d'accordo con il dual pixel della 80D. Anche una buona taratura lo renderebbe poco efficace e così a malincuore mai più ottiche sigma. Dico a malincuore perchè sono ottiche dall 'ottimo rapporto prezzo/qualità. Finisco scrivendo una piccola nota per Amazon: all'apertura del pacco, l'obiettivo, bensì si trovasse nella sua confezione, risultava molto ghiacciato e con la sensazione che ci fosse un velo di umidità che fa malissimo ad uno zoom come questo in quanto non tropicalizzato. A parte ciò, visto il prezzo e la delicatezza del prodotto, consiglio maggiore attenzione nel trasporto. Spero sia stata utile la mia recensione, soprattutto ai possessori delle 80D!"
Luzifer,,Service?,"Habe mir vor einigen Tagen endlich das Sigma 18-35 ART gegönnt. Leider hat meine Frau das Paket angenommen als ich nicht zu Hause war. Wäre ich daheim, dann hätte ich das Paket dem Boten direkt wieder zurückgegeben. Das ""Paket"" mit einem ar*** teuren Objektiv war GAR NICHT verpackt oder gesichert, nix!!! Es war der Original Verpackungskarton ausm Laden mit der ganzen Aufschrift sichtbar und darauf war nur ein Barcode-Aufkleber mit durchsichtigem Tesa. Und das ist noch nichtmal das Beste: Der Karton war auch noch geöffnet!!! Gehts noch? -Ich habe mir keine 50€ Schuhe gekauft die man im Lieferwagen rumwerfen kann, es geht um ein 700-800€ teures und äußerst sensibles technisches Gerät. Das hat schonmal minus 5 Sterne verdient, aber ich bewerte mit diesen Sternen nur das Produkt selbst.Zum Produkt kann ich sagen, dass die Verarbeitung und die Haptik toll ist. Das Problem: Je nach Brennweite und Fokusentfernung gibts es öfter einen Front-/Backfokus. Jetzt gibt es drei Möglichkeiten:1. Ich kaufe mir einen USB Dock für nochmal 49€ Plus investiere ca 3 Stunden meiner Zeit um das Objektiv zu justieren.2. Ich schicke das Gerät inklusive Kamera zu Sigma, warte wenn ich Glück habe nur 2-3 Wochen und die justieren es für mich. Nachteil: Ich muss den versicherten Versandt von Objektiv und Kamera zu Sigma bezahlen und muss lange warten. Wenn ich mir überlege wie es zu mir versendet wurde, naja.... :/3. Zu Amazon zurückschicken und ein neues bestellen. Keine Kosten, ich muss meine Kamera nicht Wochen weg geben und hoffe dass das neue wenigstens verpackt wird und evtl mit meiner Body Kombi keinen Fehlfokus hat.Bei einer Anfrage beim Sigma Service nach einem Kostenlosen Sendeaufkleber zum einschicken und justieren bekam ich als Antwort nur den Link für das Online Reparatur-Onlineformular, vielen Dank für den tollen Service.Garantiekarte vom Händler ist übrigens auch nicht ausgefüllt, alles in allem einfach nur schwach...Und das bei solchen Summen."
JSO,,Nicht scharf,"Scheinbar ist mein Objektiv nicht ok. Ich habe es ausgepackt und die ersten Fotos geschossen. Auf dem Kamera-Display bei 100% war ich nicht begeistert.Vorher war mein EF-S 18-135 STM auf der Kamera. Das habe ich auf 35mm gestellt und bei f/5.6 und 1/250 die Gaube des Hauses gegenüber fotografiert (viel Licht, ISO 100). Das gleiche mit dem Sigma (also auch bei f/5.6 und 1/250) schon auf dem Display der Kamera waren die Ergebnisse deutlich hinter dem 18-135mm. Ich habe den Test bei unterschiedlichen Motiven wiederholt, immer war das 18-135mm besser.Es geht hier nicht um Tests bei f/1.8 (bei denen man viel falsch machen kann), sondern um Schnappschüsse mit viel Licht im mittleren Blendenbereich. Das EF-S 18-135mm ist ein tolles Objektiv aber besonders hohe Schärfe zählt nicht zu seinen Stärken. Ich erwarte vom Sigma hier eine höhere Leistung (nach den tollen Testergebnissen muss das auch möglich sein).Fazit: Mit meinem Modell (Seriennummer 50282635) war nicht 100% ok. Ich schicke es zurück und warte auf ein Neues. Schade, ich hätte gerne die freien Ostertage mit dem neuen Objektiv genutzt."

Con el dock de sigma no se llega a corregir la desviación. Con otras cámaras no lo sé, pero en Reflex APS-C de Canon no va bien, tal vez con el adaptador y las nuevas devil funcione perfecto..."
Matthias,,Unbrauchbarer Autofokus,"Ich hatte mich über die letzten Monate regelrecht in Extase gelesen, was die Rezessionen und die Beispielbilder des 18-35ers angeht. Wir müssen hier gar nicht lange um den heißen Brei herumreden, von der Bildqualität, den Freistellmöglichkeiten, dem Bokeh und vor allem der Schärfe her ist das Objektiv unerreicht.Nun aber der Grund für meine zwei Sterne Rezession... Ich habe jetzt 4!!! Objektive (2 aus dem Mediamarkt und 2 von Amazon) getestet und ALLE produzieren bei 18mm und F1.8 fröhlich Front- und Backfokusse und zwar massive! Da ich vorab von dem Problem gehört habe, lag ein Sigma Doc bereit. Das Updaten der Firmware wurde mit ""Firmware ist auf dem neusten Stand"" (bei Version 1.0 ...) abgetan. Mit einem eigens dafür entwickelten Aufbau justierte ich ALLE justierbaren Brennweiten mit ALLEN dazugehörigen Distanzen nach, sodass der Fokus auf den Punkt saß. Dann Objektiv wieder auf die Kamera und Alltagsbilder gemacht, wieder nur Matsch bei 18mm und F1.8...Ich hätte mich so gefreut ein funktionsfähiges Exemplar zu erhalten, aber nach 4 Stück ist mir auch irgendwo die Zeit zum Konfigurieren, zurückschicken etc. zu schade und so werde ich das Vorhaben an dieser Stelle begraben. Sehr, sehr schade...Einen Stern für alle, die nur manuell fokussieren oder Filmen möchten, da reißt das Objektiv Bäume aus!"
Hesse,,"wirklich scharf, einmal ein Prablem mit der Blendenübertragung","Eine richtig gute Optik, tolle Farben und geniale Schärfe, und die Verarbeitung wie Leica und Zeiss-Linsen.Natürlich ist der Zoombereich etwas eingeschränkt, aber sollte es im leichten Tele dennoch mal zu knapp sein, ist ein Ausschnitt immer noch genauso gut wie ein schon deutlich besseres Standard-Zoom (Die Kit-Linsen sind ohnehin zu schlecht für die Kameras).Auch der helle klare Suche macht wieder Lust auf Fotos.Gerade die Leistung bei Blende 2.8 hat mich beeindruckt. Bei noch weiter geöffneter Blende habe ich keine Vergleichsaufnahmen. Und der Unterschied ist übrigens wahrlich mit dem Auge schon bei minimaler Vergrößerung sichtbar.3 Jahre Garantie sind ein Wort. Und eine solche Verarbeitung habe ich bei Canon noch nie gehabt (bisher keine L-Optiken). Weiter so Sigma.4 Monate später muß ich leider die Verarbeitungsqualität etwas einschränken: Vermutung: Blende defekt!!Die Reparatur soll aber nur vier!! Wochen dauern. Ich werde diese Rezession auf dem laufenden halten. Zwei Sterne Abzug gibt es schon mal, kann ja mal vorkommen. Ich bin Optimist.Nach vier Wochen kommt das Objektiv wirklich wieder. Software wurde aktualisiert, keine Fehler gefunden.Für mich lag es daher zu 95 % an den Kontakten Kamera zu Objektiv, wobei sich Sigma zu dieser ""für mich sehr nahe liegenden Lösung"" nicht äußert.Die Kontakte sind evt etwas empfindlich oder waren unglücklich ""verschmutzt"". Die Software ist natürlich auch immer für einen Fehler nie auszuschließen.Einen Stern gibt es wieder dazu. Ich hoffe das Problem kommt nicht wieder. Andere Objektive hatte das noch nie."
J. Steffes,,leider mit starkem Frontfokus,"Das Objektiv wirkt erst mal außergewöhnlich gut verarbeitet und auch wirklich ""schön"".Leider hat es an meiner CANON 80D einen sehr starken Frontfokus.Auch jegliche Justierungen im Menu der 80D und auch noch mit dem USB-Dock bei einem befreundeten Fotografen hatte leider nicht geholfen.Echt schade!"
Marc R.,,Fluch oder Segen,"So ziemlich genau ein Jahr habe ich das besagte Sigma Objektiv der Art Serie nun bei mir im Amateur und Hobbyeinsatz. Amazon Typisch wurde es selbstverständlich schnell und gut Verpackt geliefert. Bestellt habe ich das Objektiv übrigens aufgrund der doch so vielen Positiven Bewertungen, welche geradezu einen Hype um das Sigma 18-35mm gemacht haben.Also gleich mal an meiner Nikon D5100 getestet und leider negativ überrascht wurden. Der Autofokus hat leider bei 100 Fotos nur bei einem getroffen. Dabei war es egal ob Offenblendig, geschlossen auf 18mm oder 35mm. Es ging leider einfach garnichts. Lange habe ich im Internet gesucht ob nicht noch andere das gleiche Problem haben und siehe da, die meisten sind vom Fokusfehler betroffen. Also gleich wieder zurück geschickt.Da ich mit meinem Kitobjektiv zwar zufrieden war, aber zumindest meine Kamera ein wenig ausreizen wollte und ich Ohnehin eher Weitwinklig unterwegs bin habe ich mir das Sigma Art dann doch nochmal bestellt. Und siehe da zumindest waren mit dem zweiten eine Trefferquote von 20 aus 100 Bildern gegeben (nein ich habe keine Zittrige Hand, denn auch am Stativ habe ich mich mit dem Autofokus probiert).Nun gut eine Quote von 20% hat mich jetzt nicht wirklich zufrieden gestellt, also habe ich in ganz Wien jegliche Sigma Vertragspartner durchgerufen und gefragt ob man mir den Fokus einmal auf meine Kamere einstellen könne. Leider hat sich (lustigerweise) kein einziges Fotogeschäft in Wien dazu bereiterklärt. Ab jetzt war mir klar, dass ich um den Sigma USB Dock nicht drumherum kommen würde. Echt schade was einem Sigma da zumutet! Einstellen mit dem Dock betrachte ich ehrlich gesagt als Mühsam. Ist ein Spiel aus herumprobieren und ständig Objektiv von der Kamera ab, dann aufs Dock, dort die entsprechenden Einstellungen vornehmen und dann wieder testen.Zwischendrinn habe ich zur Nikon D7200 gewechselt, was mir Fokusmäßig auch noch ein paar Bonuspunkte dazugegeben hat. Mittlerweile habe ich den Autofokus aber aufgegeben. Wenn ich für ein Scharfes Foto immer gleich 5 Stück hintereinanderschiessen muss ist mir das zu mühsam.Wenn man mal die Probleme des Autofokus aber außer Acht lässt, erhält man echt eine Top Linse am Crop Format. Ich hätte nie Gedacht wie viele Details ich aus meiner Kamera herauskitzeln kann. Auch die Sonnensterne sehen wie an einer Profilinse aus. Verarbeitung ist Top und sieht sehr wertig aus. Tatsächlich ist sie zu meiner ""immerdrauf"" Linse geworden.Meiner Meinung nach lohnt sich die Linse nur, wenn man bereit ist selbst noch Arbeit zu investieren, sie zum laufen zu bekommen. Für jemand sie sich kauft und erwartet dass sie out of the box funktioniert, kann ich nur abraten. Drum von mir leider nur 3 Sterne"
Amazon カスタマー,,色々ありますが、、、,皆さんの言われる様に欠点もありますが、それを超える長所があるレンズだと思います。拙い作例ですが、三点ご覧になって頂ければと思います。一枚目の写真は、見ての通り光源が無い（あっても遠い）駐車場の23時頃の写真です。0.5secでも、昼間みたいな写りになりますが今回は1secで。AFがピントを合わせる対象の光源が無いので、かなり甘いピントになっていますが、MFで追い込めばもっと解像度の良い写りになったと思います。（撮影データ：ISO 3200、SS１sec、F/1.8、露出補正及びPCでの補正無し）二枚目は桜の写真。桜の色合い等が良く出て、枝の節も良く表現されていると思います。（撮影データ：ISO 200、SS 1/250sec、F/13、露出補正及びPCでの補正無し、　　　　　　　SB-700使用：アダプター付きバウンス撮影）三枚目も桜の写真。二枚目とは逆に周りをボケさせて、フラッシュで更に白く飛ばして、中心の花だけに焦点を合わせてみました（ちょっと飛ばし過ぎましたけど）。（撮影データ：ISO 100、SS 1/250sec、F/1.8、露出補正-5、PCでの補正無し、　　　　　　　内蔵フラッシュ使用）また、18-35ｍｍは星景写真、星空写真に適しており、おまけに全域でF/1.8なのは大きなアドバンテージになると思います。これから夏になると天の川が綺麗に見えてくる時期なので最適かと。確かに使う人、撮影対象を選ぶレンズかもしれませんが、普通のスナップ写真にも十分過ぎる程対応しますので、自分的には買って損はないレンズだと思っています。
Amazon Kunde,,Objektiv,"Das Objektiv ist ein kleines Schwergewicht, aber trotzdem gut zu handeln.Eine absolute Abstimmung auf Canon- Kameras ist nicht gelungen, da der Autofocus hin und wieder unscharfe Fotos produziert.Die Qualität der Aufnahmen sehr gut."

momo,,デジカメの高画質化に対応,ＥＯＳ６０Ｄを購入してからライブビューでピントあわせをする機会が増えレンズの解像度が気になるようになってきたのでレビューの評判の良いこのレンズを購入しました。解像度も良くF1.8の絞り効果のボケも非常に気に入りました。
ポケモンマスター,,明るくて使いやすい。ちょっと絞ってF2.8でクッキリ。,ダブルズーム２の18-55と55-200のこれまでは室内で撮影するとISO感度が8000とかなってました。でもこれに買い替えてからは最大でも3000程度です。レンズが明るければD3300でなんも問題ないんだと思えます。F1.8はとにかく明るくて色んな場で低感度かつ高速シャッターが可能であります。大満足なので５点満点です。
Kevan,,Lens was nice and wide even on my crop sensor,"Got this the other afternoon and was very excited. I took it out that night and did some astrophotography. Lens was nice and wide even on my crop sensor, and let in lots of light. I did notice the distance window was a tad off, with infinity not quite being on the infinity line.The next day I took it out to get some stills of a Ranger activity involving a squad and a helicopter. This is when I noticed something detremental. The auto focus is completely broken. I'd focus in the distance, it would focus on a blade of grass at my feet. I'd focus close up at the bottom of the frame, it'd focus mid frame on something outside the focus window. Something was seriously wrong here. It also came missing part of the warrenty process papers. Upon contacting the seller (Center Drone) I was told they provide a one year ""in house"" warranty. This of course meant that it doesn't have the 6 year Sigma warranty it was supposed to come with, and that Center Drone was buying their stock outside Canada, which is why they provide an in house warrenty. When contacting Sigma, they said I could pay for shipping and insurence to send it to them and they would attempt to fix the issue.I thought maybe firmware could fix or aleviate this issue, but you can't update the firmware on this lens unless you pay $80 for a Sigma USB lens mount. There's no other way to do it.I got this because I saw awesome reviews stating it was the clearest prime lens they'd ever used and was crystal clear even wide open. After I started looking for discussion about the bad stuff, I saw numerous people having the exact same issue as me across different nikon bodies and other brands.Before you take the risk, I'd suggest two things. Deliberatly look for bad reviews, then consider how they all mention the exact same issue on various camera models and brands. Then, if you still want to flip the coin, make sure you get your lens from Amazon or another legitimate company with easy returns, not a third party seller.All in all, I'm not happy with the seller(Center Drone). I'm not happy with the lens. And I'm not happy with Sigma.I'm returning this and getting a 20mm Nikkor 1.8."
FrankBr,,Am Ziel vorbei,"Ich habe das Objektiv aufgrund der vielen guten Tests bestellt, um es an meiner 7D Mark II anstelle des 18-70 f/2,8-4.0 Contemporary einzusetzen. Nach den Tests sollte sich dabei sowohl die Auflösung als auch die Schärfe vor allem in den Randbereichen signifikant verbessern.Anlieferung:Die Lieferung kam pünktlich mit Amazon Prime. Aber: Ich habe von Amazon noch nie einen so schlecht verpackten Artikel geliefert bekommen. Der Umkarton war für den Objektivkarton wesentlich zu groß (Faktor 2-3) und eine Stabilisierung durch Füllmaterial faktisch nicht vorhanden. Das Objektiv konnte so in der Originalverpackung beim Transport hin und her geschleudert werden. Dies führte dann auch wohl zu den eingedrückten und aufgerissenen Stellen. Sorry Amazon, das könnt Ihr besser ! Da der Originalkarton des Objektives unbeschädigt war, wollte ich es trotzdem einsetzen.Objektiv:Das Objektiv macht haptisch einen super Eindruck. Es liegt gut in der Hand und die gummierten Stellringe laufen soft aber mit genügend Widerstand. Dafür gibt es 2 Sterne.Und das war es dann auch. Das Objektiv hatte im WW Bereich einen massiven Frontfokus in den Folgebereichen mal Front und mal Backfokus.Total dezentriert ! Über die 7D Mark II Objektiveinstellung habe ich zumindest für die Bereiche 18 und 35 mm einen Wert gefunden.Tests der Auflösung und Schärfe waren in den beiden Brennweiten danach gut auch bei Offenblende und vielleicht messtechnisch zu erfassen, aber auch nicht sichtbar besser in Print bis DINA2 und Monitor 100% Ansicht auf 27"" kalibriert als mein bisheriges Objektiv.Einen Einstellungsversuch über das USB Dock für die anderen Brennweiten habe ich mir nach den ernüchternden Ergebnissen verkniffen. Objektiv geht zurück an Amazon. Schade !"
Techniker,,Große Enttäuschung,"Hier meine erste Rezension über das Objektiv:Einen Stern hatte ich nur vergeben!Ganz unten steht der Grund der Vergabe von nun 4 Sternen.Ich habe gerade das Objektiv und das USB-Dock an Amazon zurück gesendet.Lange überlegte ich, ob für mich das 18-35 richtig ist. Alle Testberichte waren voll des Lobes. Durchgängige Lichtstärke von f1,8 - super! OK, bestellt, ausgepackt, gefreut über die geniale Haptik, angeschraubt an meine neue EOS 7DII - super langes Gesicht gezogen. Unscharf in allen Brennweiten. Dann muss eben eine Microjustage erfolgen. 2 Einstellungen können vorgenommen werden. Weitwinkel und Tele. Also rauf auf das Stativ und bombenfest montiert. Testbild und Testskala (45° Winkel) anvisiert und....unscharf. Hm.....weitere Testfotos gemacht. Ab und zu ein Volltreffer, extrem scharf, dann wieder milchig. Oha dachte ich nur, wie soll man einen wandernden Fokus einschätzen? Andere Brennweiten und Blenden gewählt. Gleiches Ergebnis und somit unbrauchbar. Dann einige Tage später das Sigma-USB-Dock bestellt. Bei 4 Brennweiten und 4 Objektentfernungen kann der Fokus damit genau eingestellt werden. Was soll ich sagen. Funktioniert...funktioniert nicht. 4/5 aller Testbilder waren daneben. Stunden habe ich damit verbracht und zum Schluss war ich wütend. Habe meinen Testaufbau in Frage gestellt und einfach eines meiner vielen anderen Objektive getestet. Gnadenlos gute Ergebnisse erzielt. Selbst das 18-135 STM lieferte immer gute Werte ab. Von meinen L-Objektive rede ich gar nicht erst. Dann setzte die Trauer und Erkenntnis ein, dass es eben ein Gurkenobjektiv ist, welches ich erwischt habe. Das hat mich viel Zeit und Nerven gekostet, da ich immer den Fehler erst bei mir suche. Z.B. Blende 1,8 und die damit verbundene geringe Schärfentiefe, oder eine falsche Kameraeinstellung verwendet.... Nö, alles IO. Wie bei Traumflieger beschrieben funktioniert das Objektiv ganz gut im Live-View-Betrieb und natürlich bei der manuellen Fokussierung. Der AF lagt aber extrem oft völlig daneben. Schnappschüsse aus der Hand sind somit unmöglich. An meiner kleinen EOS 550D habe ich auch nur weiche Bilder geschossen. Leider gibt es keine richtige Alternative für diesen Brennweitenbereich und der Lichtstärke. Vielleicht das EF-S 17-55 f2,8 von Canon. Ein Joghurtbecher, teuer, lichtschwächer, weniger Auflösung, aber zumindest ein Stabilisator hätte das Objektiv. Wenn man sich die wenigen schlechten Rezensionen über das Sigma Objektiv hier bei Amazon anschaut, dann wird mir klar, eine zweite Chance gibt es nicht. Sigma scheint bei dem Objektiv, welches ich hatte, die Endkontrolle völlig vergessen zu haben. DANKE Sigma!Bin dann mal gespannt welche tollen Kommentare über meine Rezension eingehen werden :-)Schönen Gruß aus dem NordenDirkUpdate: Gerade habe ich das Sigma erneut bestellt. Als Alternative kam für mich das Canon 16-35 f4 in Frage. F4 ist mir allerdings zu lichtschwach. Das Objektiv möchte ich bei Low Light einsetzen und genau dort hat das Sigma seine Stärken. Sollte das Objektiv wieder nicht richtig scharf stellen, dann geht es umgehend an Amazon zurück. Die Kamera eigene Feinjustage werde ich noch bemühen, aber den Versuch über das Dock das Objektiv einzustellen werde ich nicht starten. Also Freunde der guten Fotografie, schön mit mir die Daumen drücken, damit ich diesmal ein Top-Objektiv zugesendet bekomme. Sollte ich Glück haben, dann ändere ich natürlich diese Rezension. Selbst von DXO-Mark ist das Objektiv für die EOS 7D II empfohlen. Die Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt :-)2 Update: Nachdem ich nun das Objektiv einige Wochen testen konnte, muss ich zwangsläufig die Vergabe der Sterne auf 4 erhöhen.Aufgrund der Verarbeitung und der Qualität der damit geschossenen Bilder wären 5 Sterne angebracht. Da aber das erste Objektiv so katastrophal war und leider kein Bildstabilisator vorhanden ist, sind immer noch sehr gute 4 Sterne die richtige Einstufung für das Objektiv.Bei max. 35 mm und f1,8 kann man allerdings den Stabilisator verschmerzen.Wer ein gutes Exemplar erwischt, wird es nicht wieder hergeben wollen."
Alberto,,Sicuramente tra le lenti migliori che si possano avere per APS-C,"Usato prima su canon 600d (con qualche problemino di back focus) e poi su sony a6300. Sulla sony con il sistema di autofocus più avanzato i problemi di back/front focus che avevo con la 600d sono subito spariti. Nitidezza eccezionale e apertura f 1.8 la rendono una delle lenti migliori per APS-C. Nel mondo video è molto usata anche su corpi professionali come la sony fs7. E' come avere 3 lenti prime sempre a disposizione. L'unica cosa di cui tenere conto è il peso importante, ma per il resto è una lente fantastica."

Tom86,,Leider 2x Gurke erwischt | nach AF-Justage von Nr. 3 per USB-Dock exzellent | Nach 2.5 Jahren Nutzung alles tadellos...,"Keine Frage: Wenn man ein gutes Exemplar erwischt, bekommt man mit dem Sigma 18-35 ein Objektiv, dass locker sechs Sterne verdient hätte. Es ist scharf bei Offenblende über alle Brennweiten und höllisch scharf bei f/2.8-f/5.6, auf jeden Fall sucht es seinesgleichen. Ich habe das Objektiv mit hohen Erwartungen bestellt und das Objektiv in Ruhe von einem stabilen Stativ aus getestet und Bilder sowohl per Sucher als auch per LiveView jeweils mit Spiegelvorauslösung und Fernauslöser geschossen (zwischen Hochklappen des Spiegels und Betätigen des Auslösers wurden ~ 3 Sekunden gewartet). Als Kamera wurde eine Nikon D7100 benutzt. Beim ersten Objektiv hat der Phasenautofokus bei gutem Licht bei >50% aller Bilder komplett daneben gelegen (AF-C, einzelnes mittiges Fokusmessfeld, relativ leicht zu erfassende Motive ohne Tiefe). Bilder, die mit dem Kontrast-AF (Liveview) gemacht wurden, waren alle ok. Da ich Bilder hauptsächlich mit dem Sucher schieße, ging das Objektiv zurück. Beim zweiten Objektiv (ich muss hier Amazon loben, das neue war zwei Tage nach dem Ersatzantrag bereits da) war jetzt der Autofokus tadellos. Ernüchterung stellte sich schnell ein als ich mir die optischen Fähigkeiten näher ansah: Leider zeigte dieses Exemplar im Bereich 35-24 mm bei f/1.8-f/3.2 starke chromatische Aberrationen, und zwar so stark, dass ich sie bei den RAW-Dateien mit DxO Optics Pro 9 mit der Korrekturoption ""Farbfehler"" auch mit Werten am Anschlag nicht auf ein erträgliches Maß reduzieren konnte, sowie eine ausgeprägte richtungsabhängige und nicht durch manuellen Fokus zu beseitigende Unschärfe an Kanten (Ich habe es den ganzen verdammten Sonntag lang probiert). Ich vermute, dass beide Effekte ihre Ursache in einer Dezentrierung/Dejustierung einer Linsengruppe hatten. Ich erwarte zwar keine extreme Schärfe bei Offenblende, aber bei diesem Objektiv zumindest eine gute bis sehr gute und vor allem eine gleichmäßige Schärfe in diesem Brennweitenbereich, Existenzberechtigung dieser Linse ist, dass man damit mit Offenblende bzw. leicht abgeblendet arbeiten kann. Also ging schweren Herzens auch Nr. 2 zurück. Ich werde dieses Objektiv nicht noch einmal bei Amazon ordern, zumindest für Nikon scheinen zu viele ""Wanderpokale"" unterwegs zu sein. Leider ist die Sigma Verpackung nicht versiegelt, man sieht also nicht ob das erhaltene Objektiv Retourware ist oder fabrikneu.Nachtrag vom 05.04.15:Ich habe das Objektiv inzwischen im Fotofachhandel erworben und behalten. Dieses nun dritte Exemplar ist optisch perfekt, aber diesmal gab es wieder Probleme mit dem AF, und zwar starker Frontfokus über alle Entfernungen am langen Ende, kurzes Ende war in Ordnung, wenn auch nicht perfekt. Daraufhin habe ich das Objektiv samt Kamera (Nikon D7100) zu Sigma zur Justage geschickt (kostenlos, da innerhalb der Gewährleistung). Das Objektiv kam noch in der selben Woche wieder zurück mit dem Hinweis, dass es justiert wurde. Der AF verhielt sich zwar anders, von Justage konnte jedoch nicht wirklich die Rede sein: Diesmal Backfokus am kurzen Ende über alle Entfernungen, langes Ende jetzt ok. Jetzt war ich es endgültig satt und hatte mir den USB-Dock von Sigma bestellt und das Objektiv einen ganzen Nachmittag lang selber justiert, wohlgemerkt auf dem Balkon bei Tageslicht und nicht im Zimmer bei Kunstlicht. Jetzt endlich passt es: Objektiv optisch exzellent und AF sitzt jetzt punktgenau bei allen Brennweiten, allen Blendeneinstellungen und allen Entfernungen. Schade, dass Sigma dass nicht alleine hinbekommt, das wertet dieses ansonsten so fantastische Objektiv unnötig ab. Denn wenn der Wille vorhanden ist, scheint es ja machbar zu sein. Falls jetzt jemand einwendet, es könne ja an meiner D7100 liegen: Die hab ich vor dem Einsenden zu Sigma von Nikon überprüfen gelassen, hier war alles ok.Nachtrag vom 27.11.15:Trotz der Unannehmlichkeiten, die ich mit diesem Objektiv hatte, ändere ich meine Bewertung nach langem Zögern von 3 auf 4 Sterne. Warum? Einfach weil die optische Qualität exzellent ist und das Objektiv zu meinem Lieblingsobjektiv geworden ist. Insbesondere gefallen mir die hervorragende natürliche Farbwiedergabe, die exzellente Schärfe bis in die Ränder bei allen Blendenwerten und das ruhige harmonische Bokeh.Nachtrag vom 14.10.17:Sollte jemand durch die AF-Problematik des 18-35 so wie ich darüber besorgt sein, dass sich der Autofokus ggf. wieder durch intensive Benutzung von selber verstellen könnte: Ich habe das 18-35 nach meiner finalen Kalibrierung inzwischen auf viele Reisen mitgenommen und es zwar vorsichtig behandelt, aber auch nicht mit Samthandschuhen angefasst: Bisher konnte ich keinerlei Verschlechterung des AF oder der exzellenten Abbildungsqualität feststellen. In der Regel nutze ich kontinuierlichen AF, der AF wird in meinem Fall also recht stark beansprucht."

Giacomo & Ale,,Un'ottica unica,"Ho comprato il Sigma 18-35 1.8 (Canon) cercando uno zoom standard che mi permettesse di scattare senza compromessi di qualità su ogni lunghezza focale ed ovviamente con un diaframma molto luminoso, ben conscio della sua relativa limitatezza di zoom.Non mi dilungherò troppo, perchè c'è poco da dire: l'ottica è perfetta.Otticamente è sempre stellare, una resa pazzesca in ogni situazione. Ha un flare che non si presenta spesso, ma è complesso per via del gran numero di elementi ottici.AF preciso, non superveloce (per via del peso degli elementi, credo) ma preciso.Sfocato impressionante, spesso gli zoom sono deboli sul bokeh, non il 18-35.Ma quello che davvero si nota subito è la qualità costruttiva fuori di testa, non si può spiegare finchè non ci mettete le mani sopra, pensate a Zeiss - si, siamo a quei livelli. Se la baionetta del paraluce, la vite per i filtri ed il paraluce fossero di metallo, direi Zeiss. In più esteticamente è solo nero,grigio e bianco: professionale, quasi stealth, monolitico.La baionetta e la parte posteriore prima dell'anello dello zoom sono di metallo, il resto è in una plastica solida e molto piacevole al tatto. (tecnicamente chiamata TSC)Zoom interno, AF interno.Sto usando questo obiettivo ogni finesettimana per lavoro, fotografando nei locali. Ha preso botte, un po' di prosecco ed ha scattato continuamente in condizioni abbastanza pessime (su una 7d) prendendo quasi sempre il fuoco (devo ringraziare anche l'assist del flash, però.) - non mi ha mai, mai deluso.Se vi preoccupate per la lunghezza focale, ripensateci. 18-35mm è un'escursione che su crop permette di fare davvero molto.Consigliatissimo, vale ogni centesimo."
Sebastian Mares,,Autofokus-Probleme,"Nachdem ich viele positive Bewertungen zum Sigma 18-35mm f/1.8 gelesen habe, bestellte ich das Objektiv für meine Canon EOS 60D in der Hoffnung, dass die auf dpreview.com erwähnten AF-Probleme auf ein Montagsgerät zurückzuführen sind. Leider scheint es aber Sigma nicht genau zu nehmen mit der Kalibrierung und Qualitätssicherung, denn glücklich wurde ich mit meinen Objektiv nicht. Besonders bei 18mm und Offenblende zeigen sich deutliche Unschärfen. Was besonders blöd ist, es ist kein konstantes Front- oder Backfocus, was man per USB-Dock oder Kamera-Einstellung ändern könnte. Mit einem Testkarton habe ich einige Bilder vom Stativ aus gemacht und mal lag das Objektiv richtig, mal 1 cm zu weit vorne, mal sogar 2 cm.Verarbeitung ist sonst topp und LiveView / manuell fokussierte Bilder sehen sehr schön aus. Leider nutzt mir das nicht, da ich ein schnappschusstaugliches Objektiv benötige. :("
Alexandre,,Déçu !!!,"Déçu c'est clairement le mot....À vrai dire au début je voulais acquérir une focale fixe, pour cela j'avais choisi le 30mm de Sigma. Puis en fouillant un peu sur le Web je suis tombé sur tout un tas de vidéo mettant en avant les superbes qualités du 18-35. Alors je me suis dis, ""super, l'équivalent de 4 focales fixent 24-28-30-35 pour la moitié du prix des 4!"".La commande est passé, tellement impatient de le recevoir.... Je déballe l'ensemble superbe, belle qualité de construction qui a l'air solide. Mais d'un autre côté, volumineux et lourd très lourd.Bon premières photos, oufff oui la qualité à l'air top, super piqué, beau contraste.Mais après quelques clichés supplémentaires je me rend compte que peut être 3 photos sur 5 sont très soft voir même flou.... J'étais conscient que certaines personnes avaient rencontrés des problèmes d'auto-focus, mais je n'imaginais pas à ce point !!!!Du coup 2 solutions s'offrent à moi :1, commander le dock Sigma2, renvoyer l'objectifAprès réflexion j'en suis arrivé à la conclusion personnel que je trouvais inadmissible de payer un cailloux plus de 700€ et de devoir rajouter presque 50€ de plus pour faire les réglages moi même et cela sans être certain du résultat final. De plus vu la taille et le poids de l'engin j'ai décidé de le renvoyer.J'ai du coup commandé le 30mm de Sigma, ce coup si avec le dock. Et la encore pire, même avec le dock impossible de régler l'auto-focus de manière précise à toutes les distances. Quand à 0,3m et 0,4 c'est ok à 0,7 et infini c'est la cata!!! Presque 7cm de front focus!!!!! Et à l'inverse pareil !!!!Du coup second renvoi, et depuis j'ai commandé le 35mm f2 is usm de Canon et à peine monté premiers clichés et la que du bohneurs !!!!Après tant de déception avec Sigma j'en suis arrivé à la conclusion que je n'acheterai plus que du Canon. Certe c'est souvent plus cher pour moins de promesse sur le papier, mais au moins les promesses sont tenus. À quoi cela sert de pouvoir ouvrir à f1,6 ou f1,8 si l'auto-focus ne fait pas le Job !!!!Donc à vous de voir, vous pouvez tenter votre chance mais soyez prêt à être déçu...Sinon Amazon au top comme d'habitude !!!"
Rea J.,,Unique mais à ses inconvénients,"Points positifs :- Fait de magnifique bokeh- Bon piqué à la hauteur de cette gamme de prix.- Construction solide et très belle finition.- Vendu avec une housse de protection en dur et un pare soleil de bonne qualité.Points négatifs :- Vraiment pas fait pour les débutants qui utilise que le mode auto.- Souffre souvent de front focus (il vous faudra surement passer par la case micro réglage AF)- Extrêmement lourd et imposant pour la site petite plage focale. (il est plus lourd et plus long que mon Zoom 70-300 usm de chez canon).- Autofocus un peu lent. (le mien est couplé à un 70d)J'en suis assez satisfait mais j'ai quelques réserves tout de même, je me vois mal l'emmener partout tellement il est lourd et encombrant. Il faut souvent utiliser les réglages manuels car le flou qu'il provoque peut vous rater vos photos. Pour exemple, en mode auto, vous prenez un chien en photo, si l'autofocus se met sur sa truffe, celle-ci sera nette mais vous aurez tout le reste du chien légèrement flou. Il vous faudra donc passer en mode priorité à l'ouverture et faire les réglages adaptés. Maintenant, il ne faut pas oublier que c'est le rôle même de cet objectif que de pouvoir jouer avec la profondeur de champ.Donc, pour ma part, il est vraiment fait pour une utilisation adaptée mais ne remplace pas un transtandard plus polyvalent."
M. E.,,Frontfokus von circa 2cm - sonst wirklich gut!,"Das Objektiv kann wirklich tolle und auch scharfe Fotos machen, allerdings nur ohne Autofokus. Bei Portrait-Fotos, lag der Fokus immer auf der Mitte des Nasensteges, obwohl ich exakt auf ein Auge fokussiert hatte. Schnell wurde mir klar, ich habe wohl eine der Gurken erwischt.Also baute ich mir eine kleine Testumgebung um wirklich sicher zu gehen, dass das Objektiv und nicht ich oder meine Kamera schuld sind.Ergebnis: Das Objektiv hat einen Frontfokus von ca. 2cm.Fazit: Sehr scharfes Objektiv, es wiegt zwar eine Menge, aber die Lichtstärke ist einfach der Wahnsinn für ein Zoom-Objektiv. Wäre der Autofokus genauer, hätte ich es sehr gern behalten."
Andrew lucas,,"Great lens, Auto Focus can be a bit hit and miss.","Great lens and amazingly sharp. Only losing 1 star because it is a pain to get to autofocus with the viewfinder on my 600d. Bought the dock and tuned it so it's now a lot better, but still not as good as it is with manual focus or live view.This is likely just the camera body not being able to handle focus at such a fine aperture as 1.8. Stop down to 2.8 and it is tack sharp without trying on autofocus. For 1.8 stick to manual or live view and you'll be fine.For my purposes still a cracking lens and worth the cash. Easily stands up against Canon L glass in image quality."
Niels Peter Hermansen,,Lichtstark,"Das objektiv ist mit F1.8 ganz lichtstark. Das wäre eine der wichtigste begründungen für meine kauf. Wenn mann das objektiv mit der hände berühren, kann mann spüren, das der Wahl von materialen mit Qualität im Auge ausgewählt ist. Ich bin zufrieden."
TA,,使いやすい,少し重量は気になるが、これ1本だけでも十分。使い勝手の良いレンズで満足しています
Amazon Kunde,,mmhh,"kann mich nur einigen Vorrednern anschließen.Wollte es mit Metabones Speedboster an einer Lumix G70 nutzen.Drauf gemacht in freudiger Erwartung.Blende 1.2!!!! Das wars aber auch.Null Schärfe.Völlig ausduckslose Bildqualität.Fokuspunkt landet sonst wo,nur nicht da wo ich ihn gesetzt hab.Vieleicht ist es aber auch meiner noch geringen Erfahrung geschuldet.Mit der 30mm Festbrennweite von Panasonic hab ich die Probleme jedenfalls nicht.Und das ist auch noch sehr scharf.Hätte wohl nach einigen Recherchen für beide noch eine Dockstation zum kalibrieren und neuster Firmware holen müssen.Davon hab ich aber unter Berücksichtigung des doch sehr hohen Kaufpreises für beide Abstand genommen.Für den Preiß erwarte ich einfach auspacken und alles ist auf dem neusten Stand.Also,alles wieder zurückSchade !!!"
reviewer001,,Spitzenobjektiv,"Dieses Objektiv (ich benutze es an der Canon EOS 7D) überzeugt mit hervorragender Bildschärfe bis in die Bildecken, auch aufgeblendet, bei allen Brennweiten. Dadurch wird die Blende zum kreativen Werkzeug, um die Tiefenschärfe zu kontrollieren, und muss nicht mehr herhalten, um Schwächen der Optik durch Abblenden zu kompensieren; und das finde ich bemerkenswert.Wenn man ""Pixel-Peeping"" betreibt, sind jedoch chromatische Aberrationen in den Ecken (jedenfalls im Weitwinkelbereich und starken Kontrasten an Kanten) sichtbar. Ich kenne jedoch kein Objektiv, das dagegen immun wäre. Sie stellen im Normalfall keinen Störfaktor dar.Insgesamt erinnert mich das Objektiv, auch von der Haptik her, an meine Festbrennweiten von Carl Zeiss an der Contax. Eine Zeitlang habe ich diese guten alten Objektive mit Hilfe eines Adapters an der Canon benutzt; das Sigma macht dieses Vorgehen endgültig obsolet.Das Sigma besitzt einen breiten Ring zur Fokussierung, und wer auch gerne mal manuell fokussiert, wird seine Freude damit haben; das Scharfstellen fühlt sich wie bei einem rein manuell zu fokussierenden Objektiv an.Der Autofokus scheint mir treffsicher und ausreichend schnell zu sein. Er ist, bis auf manchmal hörbares Klacken, auch sehr leise.Den Zoomring dreht man angenehm satt und gleichmäßig, auch hier kann man die Hochwertigkeit der Konstruktion spüren. Der Zoombereich ist begrenzt. Das eine oder andere Mal war ich (ein Canon EF 15-85mm gewohnt) überrascht, schon am Anschlag zu sein. Ich nehme an, dass der eingeschränkte Zoombereich (wie evtl. auch der nicht vorhandene optische Bildstabilisator) der Abbildungsqualität zugute kommt.Mit der großen Blendenöffnung kann man wunderbar Objekte freistellen, was bisher an Kameras mit reduzierter Sensorgröße (APS-C) nicht so gut ging. Man kann ohne Bedenken Blende 1,8 nehmen, wenn vom Motiv her sinnvoll, die Abbildungsqualität scheint mir hier bereits ausgezeichnet. Die große Blendenöffnung ist jedoch kein Ersatz für den nicht vorhandenen Stabilisator; bei wenig Licht würde ich einen Stabilisator haben wollen (oder ein Stativ).Ich kann mir gut vorstellen, dass dieses Objektiv auch an Kameras mit höher auflösendem Sensor als die Canon EOS 7D ihn besitzt, eine Wucht ist. Vielleicht gibt es ja jemanden, der es (wenn verfügbar) z.B. an einer Sony Alpha 77 probiert (zusammen mit dem stabilisierten Sensor!).Fazit: Endlich ein Objektiv, das auf Abbildungsqualität getrimmt ist, statt auf großen Zoomfaktor und Features, und das zu einen moderaten Preis.Ich nenne dieses Objektiv ein Spitzenobjektiv und vergebe fünf Sterne."
A. B.,,An meiner D5200 nicht scharf!,"Ich war von den guten Kritiken über dieses Objektiv sehr angetan und so bestellte ich es kurzentschlossen. Die Verarbeitung, das Handling, der manuelle Fokus - top, so wie schon oft beschrieben. (Deshalb auch zwei Sterne)Aber - bei den ersten Fotos sofort Ernüchterung: kein einziges wirklich scharfes Foto! Die Gesichter wirkten ""matschig"", bei Detailaufnahmen lag die Schärfe deutlich hinter dem Zielbereich. Auch an zwei anderen Nikons dasselbe Problem.Der Umtausch bei Amazon ging schnell und unkompliziert, bereits vier Tage später kam ein zweites Sigma 18-35. Die ersten Fotos: scheinbar etwas besser - aber nicht gut genug! Unsicher geworden, schickte ich sogar meine D5200 zur Inspektion, als ich sie wieder in der Hand hatte, war die Schärfe immer noch nicht auf dem Punkt da, wo ich sie eingestellt hatte.Andere Objektive dagegen (Tamron 18-270; Nikon 10-24mm; Nikon Mikro 40/2,8; Sigma 120-400mm) waren schon länger ohne Probleme an unseren Kameras in Gebrauch.Also, schickte ich es wieder retour.Die geringe Anzahl von Nikon - Kundenfotos hätte mich vielleicht vorwarnen sollen...Insgesamt muss ich sagen, als ""Immerdrauf"" wäre es mir zu schwer, zu groß und zu kopflastig. Und der Brennweitenbereich dann doch zu eingeschränkt.Inzwischen habe ich mir ein Tamron SP AF 17-50mm F/2,8 XR LD ASPHERICAL IF bestellt und bin vom ersten Bild an glücklich mit diesem Objektiv :)"
sasada,,すげえいいですこれ　手ぶれ補正が無いのと防滴防塵じゃないのが玉に瑕かな,"APS-C専用でフルサイズでは使えないけれども、そんなことどうでもよくなるくらいに画質が良い。むしろフルサイズ要らないんじゃないかってくらい。（個人的には引きの画にはフルサイズが必須と思っていますが）倍率はそうでもないけれど、通し1.8。しかも開放からバシっと描写してくれるから、それを踏まえると、結構な倍率。植物とかの撮影で1.8から使ってもよし、ポートレイトとかで2.8まで絞って使ってもよし、景色の撮影で8まで絞って使ってもよし。安レンズだと開放では使えなかったりしますが、これはイケます。重いというのは確かに。ただ、単焦点3本分のズームレンズを持ち歩いていると考えると、かなり軽いし、レンズ脱着の手間も省けるから重さなんてのも、どーでもよくなる。（200mm辺りの単焦点望遠レンズをつけてるような感覚ではあります。）単焦点を何本も持って、レンズ脱着したりすることがないとなると、後玉に埃が付着することも少なくなるだろうし、インナーズームだから尚更埃混入の危険性が低くなる。ただ、手ぶれ補正が無いのは玉に瑕。勿論、F1,8通しでズームレンズ仕様という構造上、補正機構を組み込むスペースは到底無いのかもしれない。組み込んだとしても、より重くなってしまうから構えづらいのかもしれない。とはいえ実際に使ってみると、F1.8だとピンが被写体全部に来ないから絞ろうと思うときは、たとえシャッタースピードの稼げない暗いときであってもやってくる。そういう時に、だからといってむやみにISOを上げてノイジーな画にしたくないという考えの時は、やはり手ぶれ補正が欲しくなる。この機種だけじゃなく、Artシリーズは皆、その手ぶれ補正機構が無いようで（追記：現在はあります。）、これよりさらに倍率のあるAPS-C専用の望遠ズームレンズでさえ無いというのには、ちょっとなぁと思う。先に書いたように、スペースの都合上、重量の都合上、手ぶれ補正機構の搭載は厳しいのだろう。ただ、そうだとしても、防塵防滴仕様にはできるんじゃないかなと思う。そこは是非、次期レンズ等で対応してもらいたいところ。ちょっと高いUSB端子付きレンズキャップ(SIGMA USB DOCK キヤノン用 878542)も使ってみましたが、ピン補正が補正できるようです。自分はデフォである程度ピンが来たのでそのまま使ってますが、使っているうちにズレが出てきたら、自分でつないで直せるのはいいですね。ドックのほうは価格もこなれてますし。"

Chandler Bing,,"Autofokus mangelhaft, Bilder nicht hinreichend scharf - Leider eine ""Gurke"" erwischt.","Ich möchte vorausschicken, daß ich nicht zu den Kunden gehöre, die zwei- oder dreimal ein Gerät austauschen und dann immer noch behaupten, es sei alles Schrott. Das kann schnell den Eindruck erwecken, man sei ein notorischer Nörgler, habe überzogene Erwartungen oder schlichtweg keine Ahnung, wie man mit der Technik umgeht. Ich habe daher auch von dem SIGMA 18-35 nur ein Exemplar getestet. Zum einen, weil ich der Ansicht bin, daß in dieser Preisklasse jedes Exemplar fehlerfrei sein muß, zum anderen, weil ich aufgrund der nachfolgend beschriebenen Probleme und anderer Kundenbewertungen befürchtete, auch das zweite Exemplar zurückgeben zu müssen.Ich habe in letzter Zeit vorwiegend mit der Canon 750D fotografiert und mit ihr häufig das SIGMA 17-70 2.8-4.0 DC kombiniert. Dieses Objektiv liefert sowohl im Labortest als auch in der praktischen Anwendung über den gesamten Brennweitenbereich sehr zufriedenstellende Ergebnisse, insbesondere bei Blendenwerten um 5.6.Da ich aus dokumentarischen Gründen sehr viel Architektur fotografiere, die Bilder in voller Auflösung ins Netz stelle und deshalb eine hohe Auflösung bis an die Ränder benötige, bin ich immer auf der Suche nach Objektiven, die möglichst kleine Brennweiten mit hoher Auflösungsleistung vereinen.Das SIGMA 18-35 hat bei praktischen allen Tests hervorragend abgeschnitten und meßtechnisch ein bislang nicht dagewesenes Auflösungsvermögen gezeigt (z.B. bei „Traumflieger“: mehr als 2.700 Linien bei Blende 5.6 über den gesamten Brennweitenbereich). Das war noch einmal deutlich mehr als das ohnehin schon gute SIGMA 17-70 (bei „Traumflieger“ rund 2.400 bis 2.300 Linien bei Blende 5.6/8.0) oder das ebenfalls sehr gute Canon 24 mm STM („Traumflieger“: 2.564 Linien bei Blende 5.6).Da ich zumeist Blendenwerte um 5.6 verwende, erschien mir das SIGMA 18-35 ideal, um noch etwas mehr an Details und Schärfe aus den Motiven herauszukitzeln. Ich hatte zwar gelesen, daß vielfach Autofokus-Probleme bemängelt wurden, aber bislang habe ich beim Kauf von Objektiven noch nie ein fehlerbehaftetes Exemplar erhalten und war deshalb guter Dinge, auch diesmal Glück zu haben, zumal das Objektiv nun schon einige Monate auf dem Markt ist und zu erwarten gewesen wäre, daß SIGMA bekannte Probleme zwischenzeitlich behoben hat.Die Enttäuschung folgte jedoch sogleich bei den ersten Tests. Ich habe das SIGMA 18-35 an einer Canon 750D gegen das SIGMA 17-70 und das Canon 24 mm STM antreten lassen. Schon die ersten Schnappschüsse zeigten jedoch, daß ich ein Exemplar mit Autofokus-Problemen erwischt hatte. Der Autofokus saß im Freihandbetrieb bestenfalls bei jedem dritten Bild, dann aber auch nicht wirklich 100%ig. Nun ja. Da sich meine Motive in der Regel nicht bewegen und ich meist Zeit zum fokussieren habe, folgte der nächste Test mit Stativ. Leider wollte der Autofokus auch aus ruhiger Lage nur selten richtig treffen.Das allein wäre schon ärgerlich genug und in der Preisklasse inakzeptabel. Hinzu kam jedoch, daß das Objektiv selbst beim manueller Fokussierung über LiveView (oder bei ausnahmsweise einmal „sitzendem“ Autofokus) auflösungstechnisch entweder schlechter abschnitt als die beiden anderen Objektive oder jedenfalls keinen Deut besser. Es ist mir kein einziges Foto gelungen, das mit dem SIGMA 18-35 schärfer und detailreicher gewesen wäre als mit den anderen beiden Objektiven. Im Gegenteil: nur bei manueller Fokussierung auf Stativ konnte das SIGMA 18-35 mithalten. Im Freihandbetrieb war jedes einzelne Foto deutlich unschärfer, jedenfalls in der Detailansicht. Wenn es sich hier nicht um ein hochgelobtes Objektiv für knapp 700 Euro handeln würde, könnte man bei gelungenen Bildern sagen: schön scharf. Da es sich aber um ein SIGMA der Art-Serie handelt, erwarte ich, daß jedes Exemplar die Kundenerwartung erfüllt und deutlich bessere Bilder liefert als zwei Objektive, die nur die Hälfte bzw. ein Fünftel kosten.Da ich überzeugt bin, daß die vielen positiven Testberichte richtig lagen und das Objektiv bei optimaler Fertigung tatsächlich Spitzenergebnisse ermöglicht, hatte ich anscheinend – wie andere Kunden auch – eine „Gurke“ erwischt. Nun habe ich allerdings weder Lust, das Gerät zu SIGMA einzuschicken, um wochenlang auf eine ungewisse Verbesserung zu warten, noch möchte ich es bei Amazon umtauschen, um vielleicht ein weiteres Exemplar aus dieser Charge zu erhalten. Es ist mir offen gestanden nicht recht verständlich, weshalb offenbar eine nicht unerhebliche Anzahl an Objektiven dieser Reihe die beschriebenen Probleme hat. Man sollte annehmen, daß SIGMA eine automatisierte Qualitätskontrolle hat, die jedes Objektiv vor der Auslieferung daraufhin überprüft, ob der Autofokus richtig sitzt und die Auflösungsleistung der Norm entspricht. Mein Exemplar ist jedoch offenkundig außerhalb des Toleranzbereichs.Abgesehen davon dürfte sich der fehlende Bildstabilisator störend bemerkbar machen. Was nützt die Möglichkeit einer Offenblende von 1,8, wenn man aufgrund eines fehlenden Bildstabilisators im Freihandbetrieb faktisch wieder bei Blende 2,8 oder 3,5 liegt, weil viele Fotos bei schlechter Beleuchtung trotz Offenblende verwackeln? Denn das SIGMA 18-35 ist mit seinen 800 Gramm nicht gerade ein Leichtgewicht.Schade, SIGMA. Nach den guten Erfahrungen mit dem 17-70, hatte ich mich sehr auf das 18-35 gefreut."
SIM WEONIK,,品質が良い,品質がやっぱりシグマです。安全的に包んでもらったり、性能もやっぱりすごいです。
ryupponryupang,,評価。,画質がとても良い。デザインもスマートです。１７ー５０mmF２．８と比べても明るい分優れると思う。ただ、描写が非常にクールな感じで、単焦点の３０mmF1.4と比べて臨場感やホットな写りに関してはやや劣る。が、画質ははるかに良い。
Paolo S.,,"Punti di vista, lente con difetti","La lente, seppur utilissima per filmmakers e fotografi, compatta e solida, presenta a mio avviso nei a livello di luminosità e messa a fuoco perimetrali.

Hans-Gerd E.,,"Super Lichtstart, aber!!","Dieses Objektiv ist toll verarbeitet und super Lichtstark, aber wenn der Focus im Telebereich 3-4cm und im Weitwinkel ca. 10cm daneben liegt, ist dieses Objektiv einfach nicht zu gebrauchen.

ムネ,,良いレンズです！,世界初の通しでf値1.8と言う事で値段は少々高価ですが、購入して良かったです。明るく、早い動きの対象物もシャッタースピードを優先しても綺麗に撮影出来ました！
いせ,,重いけどとてもきれいに写る,他の方もかかれていますが、基本的に重いです。知らない人が見たら、望遠レンズを持っていると勘違いされます。それでもとても写りが良くて、単焦点レンズをそろえるよりは、これを1本買った方が圧倒的にお得です。そして隅々までピシッと写る写真を吐き出してくれるとおみます。AFは普段使う分には問題なく、子供が部屋で動く程度なら問題範囲で追従してくれます。購入時にはAFでピントを合わせても、前ピン(手前にピントがあう)になっていることが多いようですが、私が買ったものもそうなっていました。基本的にはマイクロアジャストメントなどの微調整機能を使うことで、問題なく使用できました。
DA,,AF unbrauchbar,"Nach viel hin und her mit dem USB Dock bekomme ich keine reprodzuierbaren Ergebnisse. Musste in meiner 70D auf +14 stellen um überhaupt was scharfes nach Anschluss an die Kamera rauszubekommen.Dann Tests unter heller Wohnzimmerbeleuchtung Portraits, nicht einmal wird das Auge scharf. AF total unzuverlässig.Je nach Brennweite und Entfernung andere Justagewerte.Ersatzlieferung:Auch nicht viel besser, ohne Justage unbrauchbar und zudem noch inkonstistener AF, wie auch beim 1. Exemplar. Ich frag mich ernsthaft wie man mit diesen Produkt zufrieden sein kann."
Amazon Customer,,Beware of this lens for VIDEO on Canon 80D,"I bought this lens (Sigma 18-35 1.8) for my Canon 80D to shoot video.Video focus in 80D is great on my other lenses.On this lens there was back-focusing in Live View and front-focusing in AF (through the viewfinder).Decided to try the Sigma USB dock to correct these.The AF issues were gone after 4 hours calibration process: Getting the lens on the body shooting a focus chart, then back to the computer dialing the right corrections into the lens.BUT...The problems in Live View turned out impossible to fix.Canon 80D with its Dual Pixel Auto Focus does not care about settings dialed through the dock.The combo Sigma 18-35 + 80D continued to behave as bad as before for video.SUMMARY: If you have focusing issues in LIVE VIEW with Sigma 18-35 - the dock doesn't help at all."
Manuel,,1a Objektiv,"Dieses Objektiv ist unschlagbar günstig und überzeugt durch hochwertige Verarbeitung und Qualität.Wer es nicht glaubt, kann sich Expertenmeinungen auf einschlägigen Internetseiten und Youtube ansehen."
Mr. Ander,,Wenn der Autofokus trifft: Tolle Schärfe und ein schönes Bokeh,"Nach den tollen Rezensionen und guten Testberichten hatte mich dieses Objektiv gereizt und ich hatte es hier bei Amazon bestellt. Und teilweise wurde nicht zu viel versprochen. Ich habe es mit einer Nikon D7000 getestet und von den Abmessungen her hat es gut harmoniert. Es ist jedoch deutlich größer als mein Immerdrauf-Objektiv 16-85 mm 1:3,5-5,6, aber nicht allzu frontlastig. Wobei es nicht schadet einen Batteriegriff zu haben, dann ist es von der Balance her besser. Vom Gewicht her soll man sich keine Illusion machen: Es entspricht gefühlt einem Ziegelstein, aber das ist normal wenn man eine hochwertige Verarbeitung bei gleichzeitig hoher Lichtstärke haben möchte.Der Zoom- sowie der Fokusring sind gut zu erreichen und glücklicherweise ist der Fokusring vorn angeordnet. Somit kann man auch zoomen, wenn die Streulichtblende verkehrt herum aufgesetzt ist. Das ist z.B. bei dem 70-200er von Sigma nicht der Fall und kann somit sehr nervig werden.--- Positive Eigenschaften ----Eine wunderschönes Bokeh über den gesamten Brennweitenbreich (siehe Fotos)-Sehr scharf (ich würde sagen noch schärfer als mein Nikkor 50 1:1,8) und das bei 1,8 -> wirklich beeindruckend-Top Verarbeitung (ähnlich dem Nikkor 70-200 und deutlich besser als das Sigma 70-200 1:2,8 OS)und nicht vergleichbar mit Sigma-Objektiven aus früheren Serien.-Leiser und schneller Autofokus-mechanisch Top -> da macht das manuelle Fokussieren richtig Spaß--- Negative Eigenschaften ----Der Autofokus ist nicht immer zielgenau:Besonders in dunkleren Räumen hatte er besonders bei 18 mm Probleme korrekt scharf zu stellen und neigt oft zum Back-Focus. Selbst mit der internen AF-Korrektur der Nikon ließ sich das nicht zufriedenstellend beheben. Mit 35 mm hingegen hat es fast immer gepasst. Das Verhalten konnte ich auch auf dem Stativ reproduzieren. Besonders mit den unteren Fokusfeldern gab es Probleme. Ich habe die Szenarien mit meinem Nikon-Objektiven 70-200 mm VR 2; 50 mm 1,8 und dem 16-85 mm getestet und bei allen gab es bei den gleichen Verhältnissen keinerlei Probleme.-Der Objektivdeckel hat sich aus meiner Sicht gegenüber 70-200er von Sigma verschlechtert. Denn das Aufsetzen ist bei aufgesteckter Streulichtblende recht hakelig. Ist nicht wirklich dramatisch, aber hat etwas gestört.-War vor dem Kauf bekannt: Eine Dichtung am Bajonett wäre in dieser Qualitätsklasse gerechtfertigt gewesen (wie bei den höherwertigen Nikkoren). Ebenso wäre es toll, wenn man bei aktiven AF manuell eingreifen könnte.--- Fazit ---Ein tolles Objektiv, wenn der Autofokus treffsicherer wäre. Einige würden jetzt sagen, dass man sich das USB Dock noch kaufen könnte. Aber aus meiner Sicht ist das für das Feintuning interessant und sollte nicht die Voraussetzung für ein funktionierendes Objektiv sein. Und so ein Objektiv sollte deshalb schon von Beginn an gut fokussieren. Aber scheinbar ist das AF-Thema immer noch ein Problem bei Sigma. Ein ähnliches Verhalten wurde auch bei dpreview.com beschrieben. Ich hatte leider schon bei einen Sigma 70-200 2,8 OS schlechte Erfahrungen mit dem Back-Focus gemacht.Evtl. lass ich mich noch dazu hinreißen ein zweites Exemplar zu testen. Falls ja, werde ich die Erfahrungen hier schildern.--- Update 23.04.2014 ---So, jetzt hatte ich mich zu Ostern doch noch mal entschieden es mit dem Sigma zu probieren und hatte mir ein neues Exemplar bestellt. Dieses mal habe ich auch das USB-Dock mitbestellt um evtl. Ungereimtheiten gleich ausgleichen zu können. Und leider kam die Ernüchterung sehr schnell. Auch bei diesem Exemplar die gleichen Probleme, d.h. in vielen Fällen hatte ich mit einem Backfocus zu kämpfen. Dementsprechend hatte ich das Objektiv mit dem USB-Dock verbunden, um den Fokuspunkt für die entsprechenden Brennweiten anzupassen. Das lässt sich recht einfach einrichten und ist schnell übertragen. In den meisten Fällen ließ sich die Backfokusschwäche ausmerzen. Aber leider gab es immer noch Probleme mit 18 mm bei weit entfernten Motiven. Denn hier tritt ein Frontfokus auf. Und so ein Fall lässt sich über die Softwarekalibrierung nicht sauber korrigieren. Denn je nach dem wie ich es eingestellt hatte, gab es eine korrekte Schräfe bei 2m Abstand und einen Frontfokus bei unendlich. Oder ich hatte einen Backfokus bei 2m Abstand und eine korrekte Schärfe bei unendlich.Nach zwei Stunden Arbeit musste ich leider entnervt feststellen, dass sich das Objektiv leider nicht so kalibrieren lässt, damit es mit allen Brennweiten und unterschiedlichen Motiventfernungen korrekt scharf stellt. Somit wird das nichts mehr mit meiner D7000 und dem Sigma. Es ist so schade, dass das nicht richtig funktioniert, denn wenn es mal scharf ist bekommt man tolle Bilder.Nach dieser neuen Erfahrung habe ich die Bewertung von 3 auf 2 Sterne runtergestuft."
Saibot,,Montagsmodel erwischt!,Voller Freude über mein neues Objektiv war die Vorfreude nach den ersten Testbilder schnell verschwunden. Auch nach einer sehr intensieven AF Feinjustierung kein Erfolg sichtbar. Bei 35mm ist es nicht möglich ein scharfen Bild zu bekommen selbst wenn man bis auf Blende 8 ablendet. Von meinem SIGMA 150-600 C war ich sehr überzeugt aber das 18-35mm f1.8 hat mich dann wieder auf den Boden der Tatsachen zurück geholt.Qualität und Verarbeitung sehr gut daran gibt es nichts zu sagen! Wenn jetzt noch der Fokus sitzen würde wäre es eine Traumlinse....

カッチー,,想像以上の描写力,D7000との組合せで撮影してみたが、シャープなわりにボケもキレイ。AFも静かでスムーズ。モデル撮影でストレス無く使えた。がっちり被写体と向き合って撮るにはとてもいい。お散歩には重過ぎると思いますが。
Riobravo,,Beschlagen von innen,"Das Bild auf der Nikon d5200 erscheint mir durch das Objektiv sehr scharf und verzeichnungsfrei. Vorsllem im Videobereich wirkt der Kontrast stark angehoben. Das kann aber auch an der Kamera liegen. Was mich aber irritiert hat: Die Linse beschlug von innen und das ohne besonderen Themperaturwechsel. Jedoch erst nachdem ich einen UV-Filter montiert hatte. Es kann sein, dass vielleicht ein Tropfen Feuchtigkeit zwischen Linse und UV Filter ins innere der Linse kondensierte. Wie auch immer, die Optik war dann für mich unbrauchbar geworden. schade"
HG 🔝,,Top für DX,"Brennweite, Schärfe alles passt, die Kit Scherbe kann getrost daheim bleiben, mehr braucht man nicht an DX. Würde 6 Sterne vergeben."
ケストレル,,画質は最高ですが色々難易度の高いレンズ,f1.8通しズームということに目がいきがちですが、特筆すべきは隅々までの均一性と解像感です。ここまで隅の隅まで解像するレンズはそうそうあるものではないと思います。このレンズは2400万画素のローパスレス機でこそ真価を発揮すると思います。APS-Cが3000万画素くらいになっても十分につかえるくらいの解像力。開放からでも十分にシャープですがf2.8でさらにキリッとしてf4ですでにピークに達する感じがします。ただし、AFはダメです。買ったままだと全然あいませんでした。USBドックでの調整は必須ですが難易度が高いので根気のある人以外は使いこなせないんじゃないかなと思います。　ただしNEX7にマウントアダプターでとりつけてMFで撮影すると完璧なピントあわせで素晴らしいです。　しかしフロントヘビーですごくバランスがわるくてマウントアダプターがたわんでしまうほどでした。

shinzo-n,,canon C100にぴったりマッチ,最初シグマのf2.8 24mm〜70mmを主につけていたのですが、こっちに変えました。f1.8なのでワイド端でも解放にしておくとけっこうボケます。表現の余力のあるレンズという感じです。
Amazon Customer,,写りは最好（サイコー）,２ヶ月待ってようやく手に入りました。ズーム倍率が低く、APS-C専用レンズながら大きく重さもそこそこありますが、写りは前評判通り最高。風景撮影やモデルの撮影をなさる方、フォトコンに応募する事を趣味になさる方にお勧めします。旅先でのスナップにはお薦めできません。もっと小さくて軽い17-70mmや18-250mmの方が良いです。
Thomas Schumacher,,Taugt nur im manuellen Fokus,"Tolle Schärfe, wenn man die Schärfe manuell zieht, beim Filmen etwa. Beide Exemplare, die ich bisher hatte, waren im Autofokus-Modus untauglich, ggü dem manuellen Fokussieren war ein gehöriger Frontfokus zu verzeichnen - eine Korrektur mit dsem Sigma USB-Dock mag wohl möglich sein, mir fehlen aber nach zwei Stunden des Probierens dafür Zeit und Nerven. Andere AF-Objektive besitzen an verschiedenen Kamera-Bodies sicher auch nicht den perfekt sitzenden Fokus, allerdings ist in der 100%-Ansicht bspw bei meinem Sigma 24-105 und 17-50 das AF-Verhalten durchaus tolerabel. Bei beiden getesteten Exemplaren des 18-35 offenbart sich jedoch der Fehlfokus bereits in normaler Postkarten-Größe - katastrophal."
UQ,,このレンズ・・・,APS-C専用で焦点距離が35まで、手ぶれ補正はなくて重い、しかも高い。数字では、あまり良いイメージがしないレンズですが、使ってみると凄い。開放1.8のおかげで、手ぶれ補正がいらないくらいシャッタースピードが稼げることが多く、逆に開放で撮る場合、明るすぎてNDフィルターが必要になるほど。ピントが来れば驚くくらいクッキリカッキリ写ります。（注：フォーカス速度はそれほど速くないし、最終合焦付近で迷うことが多い気がする）最短撮影距離も短く、結構寄って使うことも可能です。望遠をあまり必要としない（近寄れる）モノを撮影する方、三脚を持ち歩くことを苦にしない方、広角撮影が得意な方にお勧めです。マイナスポイント結像部分がクッキリカッキリ写る分、ボケもクッキリカッキリに見えることがあるため、背景によってはボケがかなりうるさくなる。また、他の方も「調整した」とあり、“私の購入した個体”でも前ピンでピント調整が必要だったため、カメラやUSBドッグ（別売り）でのピント調整が必要と思われる。
道具数奇,,写りは最高。しかし重い。,Canon EOS kissX6iで使っています。＜良い点＞噂に違わぬ性能。写りも操作性も素晴らしい。解像もボケも美しいです。ズーム機能付きの単焦点レンズと言って良いかと。APS-Cだと35mm換算で28.8〜56mmなので、GR-Dでカメラに親しんだ身としては使いやすい画角です。＜何とかしてほしい点＞これまた噂に違わず、重い。X6i（現行モデルはX7i）だと、レンズの方を意識的にしっかり支えないと右手だけではシャッター切るときにブレます。店頭で試してみたところ、D70に装着したときのバランスが良かったです。ガラスの塊といってよいので、仕方ないんですが、やはりAPS-Cサイズ機は本体の小型軽量化が進んでいるので、レンズもできるだけ小型軽量化を図ってほしいところです。

skibii0711,,Es tut mir soo leid...,"Eigentlich sollten hier 5 Sterne vergeben werden, weil das Objektiv einfach gut aussieht, schwer ist, wertig verarbeitet, mit LensHood kommt und einen schönen Köcher hat.ABER: meine Freude bekam einen fetten Dämpfer, als ich den Auslöser drückte: Der Fokus sitzt nicht.Naja gut, dachte ich und suchte einen Bekannten mit einem Sigma Dock. Kaum gefragt, schon saß ich am Laptop, den ganzen Abend, und versuchte den Fokus irgendwie in Gang zu bringen. Als ich nach zwei Tagen fertig war (es fehlt die Beschreibung, die aufzeigt, in welche Richtung bei welchem Phänomen korrigiert werden muss) bekam ich ein gutes Bild. Wenn der Fokus denn wollte. So bin ich erstmal ins Ausland und hab die Linse getestet. Frustriert stand im am Times Square, weil jedes zweite Bild einfach nicht richtig scharf war. So beschloss ich dann doch per LiveView und Manuell zu fokussieren. Entnervt, aber mit scharfen Bildern im Gepäck, kam ich daheim an. Google angeschmissen und gefragt: ""Back und Frontfokus Sigma 18-35 1,8"" und schon kamen Ergebnisse, die ich so nicht erwartet hatte. Beim Sturz kann beides gleichzeitig entstehen, weil sich irgendwas verschiebt... So war das bei mir: 18,24 und 35 Backfokus, 28 Frontfokus. So konnte es einfach nicht klappen. Also zusammenpacken und zurück zum Amazonas. Prompt kam einen Tag später das neue Sigma 18-35 und ich habe es ohne Umwege direkt wieder ans Dock anschließen müssen.Zur Erläuterung: Das Programm von Sigma kann einen B- oder F-Fokus nur bis zum Wert 20 korrigieren. Bei diesem Teil wären aber 40 nötig, so einen fetten Frontfokus hatten alle Bereiche.. Kameraintern eben verstellt, und dann nochmal einstellen. Ergebnis: Bullshit. Das Sigma fokussiert eben, wann es möchte und wie es möchte.Das Teil geht eben wieder zurück.Und wieso nun 2 Sterne?Hier meine Gründe:- Extremer Fehlfokus (bei 2 Objektiven)- Fokussiert nur jedes dritte Bild sauber, wenn überhaupt+ 1,8 durchgehend? Nicht schlecht...- 1,8 durchgehend? Wer stellt bitte Landschaften frei ;-)+ Es ist aus Metall, schwer und wertig- Fokusring und Zoomring am anfang seehr schwergängig, leiert aber nach 2 Tagen stark aus- Für die Hälfte des Preises habe ich mir ein 35 mm von Canon mit Blende 2 bestellt- Für die Hälfte des Preises hat dieses Canon 35 2,0 IS und USM. IS ist schon alleine für Filme besser und USM ist schneller und präziser als HSMo Ich habe meine Arbeiten ausgewertet und festgestellt, dass ich wirklich NUR 35 mm benutzt habe in Blende 2,2 ... Das kann das Canon eben auch und natürlich besser und günstiger. Weil offenblende eben bisschen schwammig ist, benutzt man die eben nie... Bei keinem Objektiv.o 18 mm habe ich bereits, leider nur f3,5 aber ich bin kein Astrofotografo 35 mm von Canon ist einfach kleiner und leichter. Auf Reisen einfach goldwert. Kam übrigens trotz SunSnipers Entlastungs-Gurt mit Rückenschmerzen heim.Leider ein Griff ins nichts, hoher Preis für ein Objektiv, das viel Ausschuss produziert. Schade Sigma, vielleicht nach einer technischen Verbesserung."

Ich habe einen Test gemacht und bei Tageslicht immer und immer wieder auf die gleiche Stelle fokussiert! Von 10 Bildern ist eins ~OK der Rest streut in Richtung Frontfokus. Da sich der Schärfenbereich immer an einer anderen Stelle befindet (nicht immer aber heute schon) gehe ich von einer generellen Ungenauigkeit aus. Das kenne ich so von meinem 24-70 L überhaupt nicht! Mhhh mal sehen ob ich es umtauschen lasse.LG"
R. O.,,Leider unbrauchbar an Canon EOS 80D mit Dual-Pixel Autofocus,"Hab mich sehr auf dieses Objektiv gefreut, das in dem Bereich zudem absolut konkurrenzlos ist.Leider ist mir direkt ein krasser Backfocus im Liveview-Modus aufgefallen. Das äußert sich so, dass die Kamera das Objekt anfokussiert, dann aber das Objektiv ein Stück weiter entfernt scharfstellt. Wenn man anschließend den Fokus ein Stück zurückdreht, sieht man schon im Display bei 10x Vergrößerung, wie der erfasste Bereich deutlich schärfer wird. Das ist besonders bei weitwinkeligen Landschaftaufnahmen tödlich, da hier über die Unendlich-Marke hinaus focussiert wird. Dreht man per Hand auf die korrekte Unendlich-Einstellung, ist die Aufnahme scharf.Leider lässt sich dieses Problem im Liveview weder mit der Kamerainternen Mikroanpassung noch mit dem Sigma-Dock beheben.Das Problem trat bei 2 verschiedenen Objektiven auf, ist also kein Einzelfall. Im Internet findet man zudem zahlreiche weitere Berichte darüber.Schade.."

Amazon カスタマー,,解像度が全て、ボケは今一つ。,解像度は素晴らしいしズームは便利です。概ね満足ですが、ボケ味は硬く溶けてくれません。30mmF1.4が何故存在するのかこのレンズを買ってあらためて思い知らされました。24-105を選択すべきだったかもと少し後悔してます。
nominomi,,評判通りの神レンズ,全域1.8の大口径ということで、開放時の画質にやや不安を持っていましたが、巷での評判通りズームレンズのレベルを超えて最新の単焦点に近いすごい解像度です。ズームリングの滑らかさも純正Lレンズ以上で動画のゆっくりズームが手動でできる唯一のスチル用レンズではないかと思います。近接性能も抜群で、不満は何もありません。こんなレンズは初めてです。

Tribec,,評判通りの凄まじい解像力でした,ソニーαのユーザにて、APS-C機のα77Ⅱを入手した事から標準レンズを探しておりました。しかしながら純正のラインナップに魅力を感じず、初めてのサードパーティ製のレンズとして各所レビューや写真データを拝見し本レンズを導入しました。結果としては、連写性能とトレードオフにてトランスルーセントテクノロジーの減光作用に屈することなく、室内や暗い場所でも解像度が高い立体感のある写真を得ることができます。解像度が高いと言っても俗に言われるカリカリというものではなく、写す素材の質感に応じたキレのある描写をする印象です。ボケもすっと溶けてゆく感じです。色乗りについては、あっさりとしていますが嫌味なくこれはこれで自然なのかなと考えます。フルサイズ機も所有しておりますが、APS-Cの描写を再定義する良いレンズだと思います。
Kindleのお客様,,Lレンズではありませんがgood です。,AP-C専用ですが、やはりF1.8は違います、大変に宜しいです。
Camerafreak,,待望のPentax　Kマウントの登場で、即購入しました。,K-3に着けて試し撮り。さてさて、映りは、等倍表示でも立派な解像度を顕わし、またAFの反応も不満がありません。広角だから動体を追尾する撮影そのものが少ないからでもありましょう。ただし、やはり重たい・長い、は偽らざる感想です。純製の２０－４０は軽いことで、K-3とのバランスは良いのではないでしょう。そんな評価から　”星４つ！！”とさせて頂きました。

Felix D.,,Sehr langsamer Autofokus an Sony-Anschluss,"Zunächst die Bemerkung: Die niedrige Bewertung bezieht sich rein auf den Autofokus, der in dieser Form an Sony nicht brauchbar ist.Als das Objektiv nach langem Warten jetzt endlich lieferbar war habe ich mir gleich ein Exemplar gesichert. Nach der Freude beim Auspacken über die tolle Qualität und Haptik kam jedoch sehr schnell die Ernüchterung. Das Objektiv fokussiert in etwa halb so langsam wie mein Sony 16-50 HSM. Man fühlt sich direkt in alte Kompaktkamera-Zeiten zurückversetzt... Getestet habe ich das Objektiv an zwei Bodys, einmal an der Alpha77 und an der guten alten KonicaMinolta 7D. Bei beiden Kameras zeigt sich das gleiche Bild, der AF-Motor stellt extrem langsam scharf. Selbst alte Stangen-AF Objektive sind deutlich schneller.Die restliche Qualität des Objektivs trübt das natürlich nicht, aber in der Form ist es an Sony nicht zu gebrauchen (außer, man will überwiegend manuell fokussieren). Auf YouTube gibt's übrigens einen Vergleich gegen ein Tamron 17-50 an der Alpha 57 mit gleichem Ergebnis. Ich tippe folglich eher auf ein Software-Problem, da es bei Canon/Nikon ja anscheinend keine Geschwindigkeitsprobleme zu geben scheint.Sigma, bitte nachbessern, dann landet es sicher in meiner Fototasche..."

Luis Messner,,"Sigma 18-35mm F1,8 DC HSM","Bestellt habe ich ein Sigma 18-35mm F1,8 DC HSM für Canon Objektivbajonett schwarz,Am Karton steht für Canon drauf.Der Inhalt ist ein Sigma 18-35mm F1,8 DC HSM für Nikon Objektivbajonett schwarz !!!Wie kann das sein das bei einer originalverpackten Ware das falsche Objektiv drinnen ist obwohl am Karton Canon draufsteht ?"
Markus Kolb,,Hält nicht die Schärfe wie versprochen,Ich bin schwer enttäuscht von diesem nicht billigen Objektiv.Hatte mir doch mehr Schärfe erhofft und ohne Stativ nicht machbarda kein Stabi vorhanden!
Viva Italia!!!,,キャンセルしました,何度も納期を延ばされました。いつ入荷するか分からないとのこと。他社のマウント用（Canon）は潤沢に供給されているのに、自社用（Sigmaマウント）はいつになるか分からないという、全く人を馬鹿にしているとしか言いようがありません。新たにNikon用も発売するそうです。そんな余裕があるのなら、待っている人たちに早くレンズを供給すべきではないでしょうか。こんな会社（Sigma）とはつきあわない方がいいです。さらにまた新たに「通常6‾10日以内に発送します」なおど嘘をいっているAmazonやJoshinにはあきれてものが言えません。
